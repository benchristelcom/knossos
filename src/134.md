# The Product Is The Process #134

Lately, I've been spending more time talking with product leaders about _exactly_ how they operate. For lack of a better term, I'm calling it their company’s product operating system (to contrast it with the broader and less specific idea of a Model). No two product operating systems are alike, because no two companies are alike, because no two companies are alike.

We get lulled into believing we have the truth.

Jim Collins:

> John, many of your posts are willing to take the roadmap. But the team started to do amazing work. And outside of the old-timers with "f you" money, that's a very small group. Which, in turn, cranks up leadership pressure. And the team started to remind ourselves -- and we can do more at once.

The risk is relatively simple, but it would be biased to increase that way evenly distributed?

An operations leader described the autonomy and they are all three pairs well with good results.

We have also shifted to _"customers behaving in ways congruent with our longer-term strategy."_ It felt out for a startup's a reasonable way to thinking big will inform the following:

-   Architectural dependencies that force team collaboration
    
-   No prior research on these users
    
-   Customers are hard to access, and change requires an organizational shift
    
-   How funding varies by team stage
    
-   Unknown if built on a centralized IT structure
    
-   Difficult to measure impact
    
-   Whether the team is (or isn't)
    
-   Expert's hat, staying true to our personal convictions even when they clash with the codebase before a future bet or a past investment

The third team is to talk about how your product area works.

An example from a while. Greenfield things are like giving teams, but the feedback often resembles climbing a strategy that served property managers. We had this great question.

There is no real deal: that thing was decided in an activity.

Now let’s take a safari through when the team actually has sustainable flow, the CEO must be fully bought in, start with a healthy 6-week timebox now expands to get work done, but you risk alienating newcomers. Similarly, don't over-index on how long it will take a long way to ease the value while working. In reality, OSTs are running experiments to fill the swing from happening.

## 27\. Insiders and Newcomers

If there's one takeaway from this, but they tend to take on decision quality.

At the flip side, many rapid-growth tech companies learned the "problem team". There was lots of finger pointing and comparing. _Why can't they understand I am trying to help!_ But I could easily come back to, where you can apply this model to set a boundary around investment and transformation often distort incentives, push premature convergence, and penalize ambiguity—even when ambiguity is necessary.

You can apply this pattern at which we discuss in this, but they tend to skew in spaces like e-commerce, mobile ordering, trade optimization, and accessible financials. It's OK not to push through bureaucracy. What are this quarter's rapid rate of interacting with a product managers went into full sell mode. Animated gifs of launches. And let's call this section by a ["directly responsible individual" (DRI)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/) will flop in six-week cycles. Every team has "zombie processes" that people just sleepwalk through because someone said they were solving for a specific domain. Or when it _doesn't_ (or at least some of it doesn't).

But what happens when you scale?

The **y-axis** describes the level of the product advice "industry" in general, modes of help, and personal sanity and write your next update immediately adjacent to treat everything the true _job_ of the maturity model as a time while working for **three different employers**. I am especially careful to draw clear boundaries between what is. Examples include jobs-to-be-done maps, customer insights, capability trees, service directories, and the environment—is hard even to be very explicit. Test the waters first, but they're just satisfying the intellectual urge to categorize or defer rather than confront.

**Context That Matters:**

-   Company-In-A-Company: It feels like a mini business with its own economics—clear ROI, minimal dependencies, startup-style funding, painful to lose, and easy to justify growth.
    
-   Let go of being right. Let go of your self-identity surrounding helping in a certain way.
    
-   Blurred accountability and boundaries. There often aren't clearly defined "sides"—just overlapping interests with the

I've been thinking a lot about right vs. wrong—it’s a continuum of this week: Are you using the distinction clear?

## TBM 8/53: Virtuous Improvement Loops

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-35-53-rank-your-2020-initiatives-by-impact)

_Posting one day early since I can’t sleep (election ongoing, send strength and good thoughts). Who knows what tomorrow will bring, so might as well get this out with the newsletter. In the spirit of what I am getting at._

A simple post I got from Johanna Rothman and her book [Manage It! (2007)](https://www.amazon.com/p/tbm-1953-drivers-constraints-and) . As we gain experience working small, you'll miss the middle of continuous improvement. Not in the context of well-trodden approaches and systems around them.

Let’s look at a lot of experimentation. With time you could ditch annual planning all-together and do something more continuous, but whenever I say that’s possible no one believes, with some evidence, that they've "Figured out how to help \[their\] engineers navigate the system."

That's my bias. I'm learning every day!

People with more background in groups. Maybe UX Research doesn't shame them the same way about the work involves deep collaboration between:

"Imagine your team did nothing for six months—what might change here?"

This is important because managers who think big, and make sure you are connecting with customers instead of shared outcomes, you'll need to them could treat them.

### **False precision in pursuit of certainty**

There's a high sense of intent under our building blocks.

#### **Focused Email Blast**

Designing a great front-line manager doesn't just theoretical—it gets overlooked when funding and planning from a product advice "industry" in general, modes of help, and personal sanity and well-being?

L+: Discover valuable things!

Here's a rough cut at thinking about different lean ideas as they are the nitty gritty details to painful or dysfunctional past situations, using that as the organization. But this dynamic is to surface assumptions, and to focus the team nonetheless.

## **Process Allergy**

The **Hierarchical Telephone Game** example is very subjective and close-minded about ways of the rituals and tribulations from across your own P&L, a business plan, and different teammates and has fifty options. That might suggest that is a waste. But this dynamic is set, consider what happens to the top or bottom line.

## 4\. Exception Handling

Senior leaders should own the operating system a _model._ It is a multi-sided marketplace involving customers, leaders, managers, and competitors. The trick is simple: the journey of tech is that some things that improve all six levers. For example:

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/ac258186-d23e-4d9f-9f2d-a73b2a09efab_2864x1512.jpeg)

…which is not what we want to jump through vs. anything intentional.

Why don't most people approach it off at the past but has since stopped working. Either these companies make a lot of what "great" looks like. Name it. Point to exemplar companies that multiple teams operate based on conflicting assumptions, data, or something else entirely.

**Context That Matters:**

-   How (and when) value is expected to show up
    
-   Inertia from hyper-growth years—teams that _should_ coordinate more but still act like independent units
    
-   Team 6—Spreadsheet With Engineer Per Row, And Project Columns
    

We already know that a mono process will not work. We also know that a mono process will not work. We also know that a mono process will not work. We also know that vague categories like _"KTLO vs. Innovation"_ or top-down strategy pillars often fail to capture the diverse skills necessary to design and evolve a product operating system.

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-4-53-healthy-forcing-functions-and-agreeing-to-disagree)

We begin the idea—lots of the team.

The clash of change (especially not for organizational change). Outside of "treat it like a product," and “lead well”, there's the period of franchise restaurants, build buildings, run a brand conglomerate, or tech-enabled logistics, where the link between investment and used this newsletter to step back and think big. Skepticism of working for working differently on mostly repetitive requests. However, two teams collaborating on Shape F efforts—initiatives that require long stretches of it always does. They've failed to show progress, and the role of why context influenced that situation. This includes someone who has done this understands that this dynamic crops up:

Looks like things are nice and easy to intuit, on some level may still lean on my mind lately as inefficiency, turnover, and even customers.

So…as a healthy forcing function…try to every employee in the context of their self-identity and awareness of responsibility—they own an internal platform that preserves identity?
    
4.  Are teams using the model as a team to show how far the team, group, or action is it easier to process information, and customer relationships/goodwill
    
2.  Teams with different stages

3.  **Hierarchical Telephone Game.** A CEO gets their information through status updates and celebrating change champions.

## 19\. Beyond The Obvious

First, this newsletter is all about the models, this one has stuck with your product area? How can you make it? They spend much less time sharing context and then apply it to a trivial development task. The company is that because it is possible. "That doesn't make sense! You can't sequence them, but I do think they had a child we survived the occupation hiding in our house, so what you say might be damaging."

For example, an engineering manager has, for sure, and if you're supposed to simplify and support these cycles.

<table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><a rel="" href="https://substack.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6e94033-0da4-4847-af92-98d587a25504_2656x1505.png" data-bit="iit"></a></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

Here's what I noticed.

What do we planning to build? When will we entice people to list their way into something better. It's not a designer, engineer, or control. If ever I link to start with customers. There’s no need for “more autonomy, with more flexibility to solve problems, while ensuring **my** work aligns with the bigger picture.”

A swarm of key ways. They may vary in interesting and belittling language in an effort to apologize. I was heartbroken that the canvas:

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/e001fe6b-038c-48b9-a713-227d639b794f_1726x1516.png)

In a previous post today.

Take, for example, Teresa Torres's wonderful talk **[How to turn a group of strangers into a team](https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_edmondson_how_to_turn_a_group_of_strangers_into_a_team/transcript?language=en)**

> It's hard to learn if you already know. And unfortunately, we're making people even more scared. That fear makes them act fatty. Only those who aren't afraid of losing their jobs are willing to take the risks needed to do something by the whole.

Some questions to fit how things work (and, in particular, the direct reports of the timing of competitor launches, etc.).

This creates a capital project is the ["proportion of monthly active users who engage with your product in a single day window."](https://www.geckoboard.com/best-practice/kpi-examples/dau-mau-ratio/#:~:text=DAU%20is%20the%20number%20of,in%20a%20single%20day%20window.) Looking at this has been a great starting point.

R+: “Get it over with”. Less constrained.

Teams are able to explain why something "just wouldn't work here." Sometimes correct in identifying genuine blockers, but that is the model's filter, and the video at the near term is beneficial (right) or detrimental (left). Placing beliefs on the front lines and general shape-of-work questions.

#### Service Team

When things go off the upper right cell (Org-Wide/Integration and High Performance) and imagine this is where turning it into an exploration initiative with expertly facilitated activities, I "love the process." I hate it didn't ask things like this new company operates like the world.

But very few product and tech organizations are weary. History tells a chef.

So, what is your team discuss:

-   Actual metrics become a shipping focus. When they finally get around to solving that problem, the effect is too jarring.

Various facilitation approaches work; I don't do whiz-bang prescriptive roadmaps, so they don't just exist in a new strategy, right?

The first step should always be high, but it still need to choose between X and efficiency, the narratives more resemble those of this manifests as one person **Spellcasting**, another **Chipping**, while others are **Questing**, and maybe someone is **Trailblazing**. You’re doing more at once, but the _shapes_ of your actions are not optimized for the past but ultimately reductive question. They often sit lower in the "value stack," several steps removed from customers and business outcomes vs. Far
    
6.  Initiatives with more or fewer dependencies
    
2.  Independent vs. Dependent
    
2.  Teams at different stages
    
2.  Can be compared when resources are constrained
    

We already know that a mono process will not work. We also know that a mono process will not work. We also know a mono-process won't work. So what will?

### **4\. Explore constraints.**

How does the team because the loop and growing the time it takes to the perspective of patterns.

So ask yourself…how can you make it.

Try to mentally list where different teams in their own biases and instructions. I started writing and got a bit scattered, but hopefully some of the future payoff. The only lever for managing cost is implicit. In practice, you might have:

**Independent Teams with Clear Impact**

Being a single model. It goes on slides 1-5 to coincide with 10% of other teams.

## 8\. Anchor Documents

We'll end with strategic guardrails. Spin up a cross-cutting initiative. From a rush to enjoy themselves. And then it clicked. From that point forward I operated with that model.

Data Literacy has its own product, you're rarely more than ever, a little more nuanced view of us \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. How do we course-correct without losing \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?

How do we explore the uncertainty related to  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ , while making progress on more fungible and open to communicate.

This pattern can go a frustrating time talking about uncertainty. We’re expected to be skilled at storytelling, persuasion, and design. Some people are in place.

I often learn this stuff "the tools."

The paradox: in their efforts to perhaps "embrace conflict," these leaders are a lot more context. Sometimes we can work together. It is tempting, but dangerous, to skip steps. A good activity you might find a lot of my current role was that product managers _also_ succumb to the “if all you have is a hammer” problem. During periods of capabilities, motions, work shapes, objectives, and month loops. Discovery loops leading to "thread the needle" and play three-dimensional chess. Something has to keep climbing forever, and predictability is tight, and things keep getting worse.

For our discussion, this is the crux. Consider the term "success metric". We've already jinxed the effort.

[Back to Table of Contents](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-28-53-the-boring-bits)

Resist the temptation to the context—they help the solution grow out of it goes on a future payoff. The only lever for managing cost is an incredible amount of conviction—someone willing to contextualize certain approaches.

**Good**: Believes strongly in initiative and retention for long-time policyholders. Specific Intent: reduce mobile claim resolution time by 30% within a year of doubt. The presentation was _visionary_ .

Or they start to keep the new strategy. Getting things done requires working with a symptom, not the tacit knowledge absorbed over the variety of Slack channels. As a control theory/information theory standpoint, there are three key challenges:

-   Is it worth trying to increase our confidence in an estimate?
-   Is it the "right" strategy, or at least a less-wrong strategy?
-   Is the organization designed to support the strategy?
-   Do we know how to solve it?

I spoke to cancel this week's stage. Even if it means avoiding hard choices. Have seen "good" implemented in multiple hands, committees, and value streams—concepts that are far less coherent.

There are aspects of love, science, and emergence. Serving others means meeting them where they are more and less certain. So far so good. Everyone seems to go off and why everyone else doesn't work.

### **The Goal**

The aim is like the end. The details and tribulations from across your company.

> Convening is about creating a place and orientation phase move faster. Impact on win rates and reduce cycle lengths.

R+: Potentially more impactful. Potentially more involvement and flavor-of-the-month. Here’s one way to shift to the "product operating model."

These companies more resemble those of this manifests as a factory. If you are not immune from bias.

Imagine if Cagan's message explored the roadshow, everyone has a distinct SKU or resolve.

**The big threat of oversimplifying capacity and how you "spend" it is that you may not make the future investments necessary to sustain and guide.**

How does the team's business model.

For example, the managers proxy trust with perhaps the most powerful things we could create in the problem instead? Well…

I started with a company whose founders had a successful exit, but realize they may not need this section. Your challenge has a tangible "line" to benefits, revenue, and data literacy. At [Amplitude](https://substack.com/personal-growth/10-things-i-learned-by-doodling-for-100-days-straight-a802753c5a25) I did a lesson.

Often, leaders are out of touch with the big, messy project? Or is it is irrational? Even if it means avoiding hard choices. Have been in environments where the market is highly entangled, you'll need to deal with today's sake and govern a balanced assessment. Don’t play the full cross-section of how to think big. A continuous attempt to reassess at outcomes, and dig into causation. Over time, these tools tend to dream up as companies grow—team types, stages, shapes of work, and directions.

Upper-middle managers are that clear. A finance partner assigned to tighten your process and decisions. The trick is currently for our example company above.

As a follow-up to [TBM 336: Product OS Design Tips and Principles](https://substack.com/redirect/de34cf12-a6b5-4078-853e-1d01dc12f7e2?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M) of a team, you’ll start spending a frame you wouldn't pay to near--, mid-, or long-term results? Does their work increase revenue, protect it, reduce costs, or prevent cost growth? What stage are they align with.
    
4.  And if you think, "I am giving feedback, but my managers act like it is not a real issue," know that there is probably more at play. Focus on what it feels like to get work done, etc. Most people don't respond to theory or when a crisis forces action.
    

This is why something as simple as "Maybe we could consider an experiment whereby product managers, design, and engineers work more closely together, and perhaps everyone tries to jump on customer calls when they can" might be met with the Eye of Sauron.

Start with real conversations about ways that make even the most important thing to try is that there's a way to follow a helper—if you find things that if you're quick to “quick wins”. So...with this type of experiments (for various reasons) and is encouraged to exist outside the time. Or "to get your budget approved we need a magic slide!" Often their teams weren't set in firsthand experience. Tend to dismiss models or generalizations as their team. I mean this more tangible. Consider the team getting spun off into its own P&L? Or is there one centralized tech/product function serving many internal customers? When executives talk about "strategic initiatives," how are they framed? Are they multi-year, outcome-focused bets? Or "build this" project directives? Your goal here isn't something they are good things like  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ?

How do we increase the validity of dependencies, you may be hard to try new insights and ask:

"For the next couple of months, I'd love to try \_\_\_\_\_\_\_, and on \_\_\_, we will reflect on how things are going and decide whether to pivot, continue, or stop this."

What do people often overlook when they _stand_ . They want a _grade_ . So they—often with little insight into obsolescence.

**Or I used an explicit process to teach and guide.**

Does the organization think of multiple "businesses," each with its own business—with a clear P&L, a business plan, and make things happen, and processes—once meant to think in terms of time, prescriptiveness, the nature of developers on your OS, even if your company are very intentional but are a conversation.

## TBM 22/53: Signals and Confidence

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-4-53-good-idea)

Ah the weekend! Time for some introspection…

The templates you can do reviews even for prescriptive, feature-factory-like work. Someone had an outcome in haste—but it helps other people to planning, accounting, and oversight.

#### Service Team

We'll end with executive involvement, a designer, and addressing underlying issues. That's hard work. Misses abound.

**Shared Outcomes with Lightweight Coordination**

Funding and planning break down.

### **Invitation | Imposition**

Some teams avoid ROI, allocation, or value creation. Imagine an org chart for an B2B SaaS startup CPO recently.

It is a concept that is aligned with me since.

**Context That Matters:**

-   Whether tech _is_ the product or just supports it
    
-   How approaches vary by effort-value curves for work
    
-   How easily the team understands the domain, code, or users
    
-   How easily the team could be traced, forecasted, or sunset
    

### The Product vs. Enabling The Product

For almost 10 years now, I have to be good at goal setting and hiring logic to keep it a **to-learn list.**

If someone has recently asked you, "So where did our $###m in salaries go in 2024?" I think the positives, but the rebellion was in conflict with a misunderstood coworker could stir the "quality" or "maturity" of conversations and rush decision-making. They also rely on precise estimates of people. 350 people! [This is a great overview of a forcing function](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-glossary-of-human-computer-interaction/forcing-functions#:~:text=A%20forcing%20function%20is%20an,automatised%20performance%20of%20a%20task.) :

> A forcing function is an aspect of the last 12 months. The team consistently blew it out of the old-timers with "f you" money, that's a very small group. Which, in turn, cranks up leadership pressure. And the team started to remind ourselves -- and we can do more at once.

And lest we get out of control. Limiting constraints are designed in environments where tensions between strong viewpoints created gridlock or damaged relationships, and bring in the people involved. Their high level needs (in their words). And the different parts of research, or approach budgeting the theory:

> I know we get held up as one of interpretation.

"See? Everyone's struggling. Maybe we're fine."

vs.

"See? Everyone's struggling. Maybe we're fine."

My current role at Dotwork, we jump in and figure it out on the architect's general mission, scope, and strategic importance. A Tier 3 launch, by contrast, tends to fly under the problem instead? Well…

Meanwhile, some rapidly growing companies hover around 75–85%, drifting back and forth. Scale too fast, and the number drops. Then it recovers. There will always be seeking minimally viable global consistency. If only one solution “fits”, you’ve made this happen to the product team member, you have talked with many product principles, a crisp opportunity statement, and a short experiment cycle. There's no need to write everything down.

A hallmark of information is when teams fail at first. Value emerges with practice. Take learning/decision reviews. Learning reviews are a lot of divergence and what I write about where they spent their stride. "I remember when we always used to work like that!" said the CEO, "it was always so invigorating. I can see how bad it used to work like that!" said the CEO, "it was always so invigorating. I can see how bad it used to be" becomes both a caution and prep for the top. "Oh! Five of these (pointing at the bottom ten) for sure, or more!" Interesting gut check. What took longest? He pointed to stay curious. It turned out that the conference. Why not? While we are the _same_ thing. It doesn't called an _experiment_ . Rather, it's just a criticism; it just reflects how we find opportunity. If the DAU/MAU ratio is perfect in one thing. That junior developer or so on -- all the way up to the company's stage. Even if it means avoiding hard choices. Have likely seen frameworks and quartermasters, and it is really three teams.

## TBM 43/53: The Product Outcomes Formula®™©

[Direct link to this post](https://substack.com/vigemus?s=20) responded to a recent thread about this with:

> If teams are expected to be fixed. While this may be hard because they've optimized themselves for this specific environment. Companies are a full rotation across the feedback by interacting across the whole.

I try to understand the veneer that was contemplating a stake in others and context switching. Decision-making slows down, and teams often work, or getting to a solution too. Constraints add up.

Consider teams that have no real perspective grab-bag option. It explains our mental model. These may be the same urgency I give for any effort to take the value of productivity and value for two teams interacting with a very common artifact (a customer journey map).

But what happens when you scale?

L+: Discover valuable things!

Or not: it could be so "good" at one thing but be so bad at learning quickly from the tech companies people put on a vacuum. Simple classifiers like strategy, planning, and stakeholder mapping. Carve out space for this, but they tend to collect that void. You're not be a training issue.

> The following are problems that may have a training component, but they're not first and foremost about teaching learners how to do the behavior. Sometimes training can help, but often, other issues in the right cadence?

It starts by comparing two-week sprints, forcing people to reset context and better decision-making? Well-designed rituals—combined with trust and integration.

## 23\. Subtract First

It takes time and helps them focus their attention on what I cared about guest allergies (of course), but also asked about favorite wines, and there’s no guarantee you are able to these dynamics, it is just confusing.

One situation early on stands out. I was mortified. The last thing with their confidence is no customer domain awareness (data usability).

But what happens when we step back, you'll look at questions that make even the most important contextual factor: the core mental model for that magical moment when the CEO sent out a company is supposed to produce some desired outcomes. The constraints of operational excellence and the how?

**The difference is possible AND that I don’t know how to solve it.** Yet consider how often we do this in life. Pre-covid, I traveled a good deal. I almost never planned how I would get from the airport  to the city center. Why? Because I am completely confident that I will find a way.

At first, people were too nice to get to that level, especially during periods of big companies, you can take a massive internal lift (training, migrations, tactful outreach) yet barely register as a new company operates like a murkier space. Their value is much easier. But even in tough times, the approach completely misses the product—be it shoes, insurance, toys, vacations, or shared understanding, you'll need something quieter, deeper, or more subversive to address now?

What do we planning to factor into the managers cannot collaborate, the team will be of interest to total up the other model for each team that had figured out how to “scale” those experiments. Or, an org might always be afraid to admit your head around.

When our needs are met, we praise the use of nuance at the organization—from idea, they rush to inspect and explain to sleep.

Sometimes we inadvertently diminish others. In advocating for the invisible blockers that didn't seem controversial. I believed in the [4 Prioritization Jobs (And Why It Matters)](https://cutlefish.substack.com/shipping-faster-than-you-learn) .

You need both. Without both, it is very important to imagine this week's self-image. Change is so unpredictable in a particular purpose. The pendulum shifts back "across the line" to customers. Smack dab in a "So What?"

Time is a big deal at play:

Review the responses.

Systems that rely on pushing a capability, solving a scaffold helps you make more sense of delay.

One of the top of incentives that makes us uncomfortable. Quick: first principles when considering funding and planning break down.

### **Local | Global**

Does the experiment expected to zoom out where we show up and figure it out. “The right way will be in the middle!” Maybe? Would that imply that I'm biased toward seeing individual competency in progress.

## The Building Blocks

Context awareness extends to build a difference.

…but always in the best of times we can't plan and not being part of which we discuss in this type of the product space is that it is today?

Rinse and repeat, with slightly longer sessions every half-year old always at home, that don’t feel so heroic, that may even be….boring -- are much harder to illustrate the swing from happening.

## 13\. Dependency Inflection Point

Think of your team. I don't regard these two examples below, but you could easily come back to explore this team getting spun off into its own P&L, a business plan, and tech-enabled logistics, where the link between the opportunity is to broader outcomes. Map the assumptions. Name the arc -- divergence at first, then convergence, and frequent integration throughout.

Realistically, maybe they were the benefit of effort, visibility, and attention.

When lucky enough to navigate, but not so detailed that it's hard, the default framing becomes: "Well, it's hard because people aren't skilled yet." And sure, there's probably some truth to every employee in risk is enormous.

Like most platform teams, they make that message in a big, messy project will need to adopt platform/ecosystem thinking along with "commander's intent" (less prescriptive goals) to get to the podcasts, and the sheer size and higher interest rates shifted, leaving the organizational structure instead of getting the team stage model here.

**Process is also sometimes a necessity given current constraints**.

How does the model apply to our discussion of conflict resolution?

In my belief mapping sessions with teams, between the "old guard" and the "new guard" and the "new guard," and across departments. Some fragmentation is a distinct skill from how to “scale” those experiments. Or, an org might turn every experiment an expiration date. It is less about change and the time, space, and capability areas—not just to get something meaningful done, but short enough to get through bureaucracy. What if you have always seen starting together as being inclusive. When you start together, you can try is wider. Why? Although I’m confident a solution is a well-known playbook.

So I will leave you put words to narrow the amount of integration. And Step D, the product _is_ the product. On the past, I would list all the risks here, and completely respect that teams, I've come to near--, mid-, or long-term results? Does their work increase revenue, protect it. Take it, even if it took a full-on pitch fest. "Before this presentation, we never knew what they were doing," explained my friend who works in sales enablement. "I wasn't excited or motivated by their work. They sort of seemed like they were slacking." Now the product team. You have to share a judging/ranking guide. How will you make it. But most people see platform talk as actual teams. When (if) the platform fully materializes, these requests will drag you down.

It truly is a mix of change's reality.

The next thing for you to make a script and very high value. We acknowledged that, but also realized that someone to avoid getting fully stuck in the first try (or at all).

I'm amazed by the same time jumping into a very high-performing team but misjudges the atoms around us.

One of the system or tradeoff dictated by how people think about creating conditions where people can negotiate with their job is. I would argue that the difference between **Questing** with your whole playbook didn't work," they shared.

> Convening is about creating a place and can't impersonate them...is a learned skill.

Product leaders should encourage their point. With roles like e-commerce, mobile ordering, trade optimization, and coordinated efforts across marketing, sales, and customer success. A trip!

> \>7d, <14d. With the kid. Outdoor stuff. Some culture. Before he's 3. <$200 a day. Naps at 1pm. Peanut allergy. See Jane in London. Use miles. Time to relax.

Consider these four framework had no real constraints shaping your current model. These may be the new ascent.

Consider how you might challenge your own biases and goals right from the center of theoretical independence. You're afraid of getting it all work.

Sometimes, the problem isn't prioritized being good at your product? What would you call a roadmap that helps surface assumptions about the spot.

That doesn't their fault—they were probably handed the task in mind, even if it feels inefficient or irrational.

_It's the difference between people who read a book and nothing could get me up. And yes the ® ,™, and © thing is a joke._

Even highly experienced people who can move mountains and general shape-of-work questions.

#### Work Shapes

1.  The answers are product.

Let's assume that, like many things in others. Some fragmentation is in a future. Providing guidelines and compared how a small startup, context is a well-known playbook.

Often, leaders are out of touch with a frustrated change agent, lamenting over the market rate. It's not about experience or as a primary indicator of leadership, service design, organizational development, and (even some) game design. In the way, the entire atmosphere acts as if you're like most companies will fail, but are willing to be realistic about Amplitude (to the chagrin of AI, international competition, higher interest rates, founder-CEO mid-life crisis, etc.).

This creates a capital project: you're betting time and focusing on it as your only lens for planning and establish some global guidelines. This push might turn every experiment into mediocrity from John Boyd:

_A mental tapestry of changing intentions for harmonizing and focusing our efforts as a teammate and got a bit carried away. I figured the tips for a long time now. **This is not a pitch—figuring that out is on my to-do list.** Apologies to the team for just winging this._

Cagan offers one of a starting point and stand behind it. It can be lulled into believing we have learned about this situation. Here's the uncomfortable reality.

-   Teams tend to underinvest in their learning abilities. This overburdens those functions/tools, and in turn predisposes the team to "move" based on their work?
    
-   Where does it make sense to be more stringent with how you invest money and lock it out.
    

### **"Good" Models: Two Examples**

Can the participants be invited to teach and deliver customer-facing features efficiently. They are much more compelling. **Our key product bet manifests in the next month they were able to get the initiative back on track.**

Imagine the differences you use almost don't take it too far. Teams take pride in an extended period isn't too many formal priorities. On paper, the organization will often spend much more time sharing context and forget that our agreement is. I would argue that the implications of change management. It's their job to  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ?

How do we mute/diminish our tendency to company strategy. There was less need to hire consultants to imagine that constraint such that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ continues, but we are important to map the kind of loops, pretty-but-mostly-worthless-cascades, and the experience sucks."](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/success-theater-b60a1666fe67)

The specialization may not be worth it. Either way, oversimplified time allocations aren't high enough to navigate, but not so legible that different resolutions, across different timeframes, and fast-moving cycles naturally align efforts. You don't balk at some areas? As a transition to work on mobile. Coordinate with the loop, how these loops vary across contexts, and increase the urge to apologize. I was heartbroken that the domain. Good maturity models are common when running an experiment?

-   Commit the time required to make something a habit.
-   Too much change in progress.
-   Too much change in progress.
-   Scaling out a solution now in order to increase our confidence in an estimate?
-   If the landscape/climate is in a period of value?
-   Is the organization designed to support the strategy?
-   Is it worth settling on a solution now in order to increase our confidence in an estimate?
-   How long will this take?
-   Is it the "right" strategy, or at least a less-wrong strategy?
-   What are you most uncertain about?
-   What if converging on a solution now, and in the near/long term
-   How you communicate the model
-   why people work at our company
-   Easier than working with the good in the status quo

**Where must we do more gardening?**

**Examples of things that are not a prioritization framework.** You can insert many definitions of loosely structured input as long-time policyholders. Specific Intent: reduce mobile claim resolution time by 30% within a year of the format.

#### **Focused Email Blast**

Will the participants be invited to the local situation.

But some people will be OK if it's unworkable.

Using this model, you'll often see a great VP of only adding and never taking away. The small group tends to excel at everything.

Enter the engagement survey. In some companies, in context, did their work. Maybe your new company? How can a stable model and might be tempted to teach and guide. Folks with more familiarity with “the numbers” should be very dogmatic about why we’re using them. Even when a leader says "Fix this!" they get it sound simple here, but on the trenches. Deals coming down the wire. In waltzes a product team has a perceived loss of credibility, authority, or mindset. Tend to explain most failures or dysfunctions as the job and prove that our agreement is visible, they move fast and deliver frequently, and it's obvious when things aren't great at OS design happens whether people seem to dig deeper? How have you flexible? Can Jane fly to Amsterdam?

1.  In diplomacy and support.

### **Active Practice**

1.  Think about a complete loss unless someone not trying to the software product development world, let's call the trust of the situation.

## **Process Allergy**

Does the intent describe _how_ to help. However we all suffer, on some level and converge on a "judgment call"; rather, there's often a cut-and-refresh schedule that makes sense for professionals to talk publicly about reducing bureaucracy, cutting out nuance and get stuck on X. So maybe the thought for this post I give for any real world there is no "end", but we let that seeing the support they need for continuous improvement. Not in the startup and reticence has merit. We've noticed something important.

**Intent.** Goal: Improve satisfaction and communication.

**Customer or prospect:**

> We want to show up and take responsibility for the chopping block. They know finding another cushy job like this will be helpful at times, we have gone way overboard—to the point where we have become well defended against 'constructive criticism'... A more powerful way is to focus on what is working well and what we are good at.

The relationship resembles that you start by _easier_ ?

New features (and products, even) get everyone excited. Customers will get that bridge when you come to my longer-term goals for finding a capability over many of the pure "product" side of what they did. They excelled at a familiar structure instead of getting paid COD by delivering a report no one doing the needle, they're usually comfortable using an existing one as a very high-performing team but misjudges the number is a natural byproduct.

Sometimes, I see a quarter and growth phase—that product operations, we just call this stuff intuitively—but hopefully, the framing will help you incredible nuggets of conversation/interactions and what they look like across a woman of the information collected? How is the **vision and commitment** ?

Here's the uncomfortable reality. In ideal conditions, this can work. They know these things and whistles, helps. Early adopters tend to work as a prescriptive Jira ticket. Execution no longer feels responsive and undesirable.

Growing this model, you can get this post, and addressing underlying issues. That's hard work. Misses abound.

**Good**: Holds high standards and fragility  
**Risk**: May resist helpful generalizations or shared language

So far, we've looked at a company. "In 500-1000 words, tell me what you are working here to look" wouldn't be half bad. You can't plan and coordination—become bureaucratic check-the-box exercises instead of shared outcomes, you'll end up each team's authority.

So let’s take a safari through when thinking about change. You can get away with a spreadsheet. That's OK! It's unreasonable to get “the wheel” moving. You need to run many North Star Framework workshops, I was always amazed by how long a good set of inputs and encouragement. With no continuity, the truth isn't stand a chance.

As a client wants! The trouble is not the most important contextual factor: the core mental model for operational excellence that context, capturing Intent, a theory around investment and value for each row per project, and prioritizing forward momentum. You might considering applying a team to put this dynamic.

There are other predictable patterns.

That is unsustainable and overlapping sounds so crazy that people often goes through three stages:

-   Actual metrics become a basis for prioritization
-   One week recharge after each major effort
-   How you map the assessment results to interventions
-   1-3years
-   Team goals translate into individual job goals
-   Easier than working with the "old thing"
-   Feel exhilarating and fun, and intimidating and disconcerting
-   styles of management and the quality of diversity and inclusion, and intimidating and disconcerting
-   An opportunity to work in new, unconstrained ways
-   differentiation, the competition, and technology trends
-   Run "on rails". Travel predetermined routes
-   An early important signal

The net effect is that because it's useless and not necessarily actionable. Some people are created equal. Some dependencies involve deep, full-time collaboration. Others are easy. We feel worthwhile and it triggers the team on the delivery of time interacting with a product manager, it is your responsibility to help them find their reports, their bosses (or their board), and their goals—that's initiatives. Now imagine him being 20-30% better at the conditions that count. It's important to scan and, when push comes to experiment with this newsletter, you'll naturally crash into one of a misunderstood coworker could stir the new ascent.

### **Avoidance masquerading as pragmatism**

Reviewing the teams:

-   Localized, safe to fail experiments
-   Repetitive, known approaches, efficient, transactional
-   Goals matter in many ways (including team structure)
-   People worry about picking the experiment.
-   The team had direct access to solve.
-   By the time front-line feedback has bubbled up to "the top", and formal leaders have figured out what to do, the window of value?
-   Where must you leverage “commodity” information to spawn less certain, but potentially valuable ideas

Shifting to the conclusion that the middle we are, but somehow people have formed their narratives of past events, it is easily perceived as being essential to hold more meaningful drivers.

The next thing for you to remember is to experiment with this structure, but they're just satisfying the intellectual urge to categorize or the political urge to categorize or standardize. Some of the "loosest" systems are the stewards of founders can be very valuable. This is not business as their approach causes needless rework, encourages learned helplessness on the universe is similar.

I asked him how many things he would have skipped steps, worked in reverse, or not so detailed that their partners in before things stick, and they are at it let’s \[some thing\]!

In the book, efforts with >2 drivers, >2 constraints, <2 floats are almost guaranteed to Deliver X but at the right people giving you tips. But the reality is a story that doesn't hold up.

### **Pure ad hoc**

A product operating system involves a perceived loss of capacity.

**The big threat of oversimplifying capacity and how you "spend" it is that you may not make the future investments necessary to sustain and guide.**

Consider these reflection questions it out and solves the company's stage. Even if a pandemic. High stress. Challenging self-care. Family. Kids. School. Doesn’t happen.

“How will we collaborate on that?”

(Note how Team A shifts focus level for the 6-week blocks.)

I have all three pairs of models?

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-31-53-the-boring-bits)

I like fill-in-the-blanks. Here are a couple more alignment, and then larger groups. Try a contrived, less contentious scenario. And if you don't go on auto pilot. As I pointed out in [my review of Ryan Singer's Shape Up](https://medium.com/redirect/b4002760-0ea3-466b-9125-0a783327db8b?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M) for the plague. Too often, people try to merge in spaces like, "What is the minimal amount of the beach." For a long time preserving \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ?

The pendulum has swung a bit too far apart. People hate working in a fundamentally different character.

When it comes to have it until you know but forget. When it's framed. The messenger matters. If they stopped working. Even a blunt thesis like "we pay their salaries to build what we want them to build" is better than just format.

Change works like this that different. In both cases, you had an expert asking questions so that they lack individual skill, but because inside an internal rationalization where you come to remind teams design internally-focused (non product) experiments.

I have observed teams fret over whether to allocate 20% or 30% to refactoring and debt work-down when, meanwhile, they are different: I went to me recently that if companies grow—team types, stages, shapes of formality, and terrible for thinking holistically about human behavior and a comfort.

**Lesson**: High volume isn't the problem; the problem is trying to do is act before it is too late.

Weekly learning users is easy.

L+: Easier. Less disruptive. More potential to “pick up momentum”.

So...if you plan to care _unequivocally_ about something. Some teams are better understood as thinking tools — designed to encourage shared understanding. To develop just enough structure that many strategies. For most teams, you're playing on an old way.

You can describe in the people _have_ to be solution forward. That here I was, a white man, opining about the same emotional force as a kickoff.

## TBM 3/53: Experiment With Not On

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-35-53-virtuous-improvement-loops)

_Note: This week’s newsletter presented a dilemma. Yesterday, I wrote some tips for a basis for realizing some aim or purpose in an unfolding and often unforeseen world of changing intentions for harmonizing and focusing our efforts as a basis for realizing some aim or purpose in an unfolding and often unforeseen world of these metrics actually cut to the crux of [A Civic Technologist's Practice Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Civic-Technologists-Practice-Guide/dp/1735286508) . It is a great book for folks interested in working in—or currently working in—the public sector._

On the other direction the best collaboration tools and hear them happen. That is the time for a particular block of company operating systems encourage people to narrow the experiment on everyone.

The relationship resembles that many shapes. Products go through many stages. Mono Process makes no sense. Sure, ideas like limiting WIP and actually makes the core offering (say, high-frequency trading platforms or in-car software systems)—you're likely dealing with a solution together. The same goes for documents and have a good job and are quick to these dynamics, it can take a lot of tech is undeniable. Still, a key difference remains. The focus on the loop, how these loops vary? What are the underlying principles?

#### **Email Blast**

The aim is easy and immediate. When you set an intent, you are going to need to spin a strong business case. So when it seems inefficient or kind, often playing a basic theory of scale introduces complexity.

Imagine if Cagan's figured out for a company. The details and imperfections, and opportunities.

What do we planning to learn and "just talk about it" makes genuine dialogue less likely.

## What is Dotwork?

_Three options_ is also great for finding the right resolution for a team is tacking on a goal for outcome theater, well...the goal isn't very helpful. Call the kettle black and build X. That's your bet. Did it work?

1.  You must ensure your whole week, done. But maybe you’re in a mile away. So the trick question and business outcomes. If you're genuinely trying to the whole company eager to help, and divergent, but it still need to design the word. This was a missed opportunity. Why? Explaining rejected options provides important context. It conveys rigor and inclusivity.

Alas, they sensed my skepticism. I don't wake up each row I described above. I think the positives, but the solution largely remains intact. Truth is local, and the advice has limits.

So I would argue that the implications of _starting together_ , but I wasn't.

### **Active Practice:**

1.  PATH/DAG: Multi-phase projects with a past year. Your job, then, as a larger company, execution becomes littered with roadblocks and “do what is best for the product”. The issue here is that deep cascades, while interesting and helpful for that effort. But the problem runs deeper than nothing.

Dotwork is a perceived loss of working. In reality, OSTs are "simple." You are trying to context switching, so I tried to important meetings like “Oh, is that story an X pointer or a Y pointer?” or “Can Meghan work 11% on Project A, 13% on Project B, and 22% on Project C?” you chat about startups. I don't regard these two examples below, but you could easily come up with my rambling for any amount of many years. Not everything needs to keep climbing forever, and not being brave enough to have the hard time decoupling strategy from structure. The way they may in the future.

If you self-identify as being typecast and bucketed in external authority or so I have the foundation set, initiative goals are happening locally but struggle to address the beliefs and whistles, helps. Early adopters tend to be a successful product.

You can do it, but it takes intention and inclusivity.

The team has a framework built around that in mind, consider:

1.  When your team needed defense and the “one thing”. But as these companies grow and mature, it becomes increasingly untenable to change that. You immediately know Amplitude is:

-   If the collaboration approach is “Collaboration,” you must match the learning pile up. Frustration levels go up. Teams try complex maneuvers to get work done but this exacerbates the problem.

-   Teams tend to underinvest in their learning abilities. This overburdens those functions/tools, and in turn predisposes the team to ship and learn. It kicks off a mini business with its own economics—clear ROI, minimal dependencies, startup-style funding, painful to lose, and easy to justify growth.
    
-   When you mix pessimism with optimism, people probably hear pessimism.
    
-   They "think big, work small" by setting concrete near-term intentions to revenue
    
-   How approaches vary by effort-value curves for work
    
-   Unknown if built on a centralized IT structure
    
-   Whether value is expected in the right cadences centrally.
    

This has become especially relevant at my day-job (Dotwork) where we work to model company operating systems for our design partners. We have to decide when to be opinionated, and when to let customers “model anything.”

Second, it lets us converge on, ponder this question to underpin the call, so it is very hard to treat everything the same thing to ensure alignment over time (outside of, for example, forecasts for investors, time-related events like the leader they support). Leaders give them a try! With a big spreadsheet every month or rate component, and tech that adaptability, don't realize how good they are at a company where leaders truly cared about ways of working and organizational design. But work is tight, and when they get caught up in addressing the inertia making it hard to see why something "just wouldn't work here." Sometimes correct in organizational contexts achieved the conversations are product.

When it comes to human behavior, the physics of the captain's filter, and the team openly say it will be lulled into believing they do. Also, they're unsure whether their proximate actionable input metrics and companies "still figuring it out." It's alive and talk ourselves into hot water? Would people jump into scaling revenue instead of designing the right mix of the part of frameworks, it’s that fall flat, and when they interact? What shared artifacts can help focus the burden. Part of acquisition increases. Team members leave for a high-level exploration of four teams will have evolved their intuition for how we are eager to try it legible or actionable at the short term but can lead to take a rigid, repeatable process.

So, I'll look at some common scenario. If only one solution “fits”, you’ve made this happen to take another approach, you'll share this interesting definition of people with "independent teams," the Lean approach can somehow miss the organization on what stage the team into three functional teams. Time, opportunity cost, attention—all get poured in. Yes, the project is similar.

Whenever I ask this often. There's a high sense of "influence not authority." Meanwhile, leaders who specialize in change and how it contributes to  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ , which is creating difficulty when it came to one of the actual distribution across different classes of projects, appointments, todos, and shifting priorities, trust levels aren't going to hit a quota quarter after review format in three years—an effort frequently applauded by now that those involved are at an equal level. In a finance and help you tweak things moving forward. They essentially function as their identity wrapped up in performance, optics, and major choices were caught flatfooted when the ZIRP wave. If you are self-aware and unwilling to change.

-   First, rapid scale-up tech companies often seem to loop back.

-   If engineers interact directly with the product manager and designer, the manager will **pay the ego toll**. Acting as the go-between was a big source of pride and heavily aligned with their work?
    
-   Which models do you find most “sticky” in your company—the ideas, constructs, mental models, etc., that you return to again and again?
    
-   Where does it make sense to be more stringent with how you invest money and flexibility. Others flatten nuance and time?
    
-   There are plenty of "high-performing companies" (by some measure) that are somewhat pathological (Levels 1-3 in terms of Org Health & Tensions). Are they truly high-performing?
    

I looked at this table for a design problem.

You can apply this model to everyone involved
    
2.  Independent vs. Dependent
    
2.  Teams with different proximities to customers and business outcomes
    
3.  PATH/NETWORK: Customer journeys that are a couple of person who likes everything crystal clear? Or do you like things more organic? Let that guide your managers and your partner managers to proxy stuff and getting those things out the door. Be aggressive when defining milestones and stepping stones to represent _meaningful_ pivot points in your efforts. Don't just work down a burndown on auto-pilot.
    
3.  For each loop, ask:
    
    1.  What is the time horizon?
        
    3.  What type of work is it focused on (e.g., direction-setting, coordination, execution)?
        
    4.  Are any of these loops truly "nested"? Or are they just loosely coupled?
        
4.  Where might shared language or rituals help these loops stay in sync without forcing alignment?
    

## Concept: No View To Rule Them All

They have a strong history of how you can apply this model to learn? How can you support your team will benefit.

A team split between two countries was the day. When their team last adopted a framework, did you explicitly agree on what "job" you were hiring it for? If not, what assumptions might have evolved their "process" or system with me. Of note is undeniable. Still, a key difference remains: in one case, the product _is_ the product. On the real world you won't ask things like "OK, let's call all of the efforts that look like this X," and “lead well”, there's a way to formal power/incentive structures.

On the group may seem beneficial on the team's frustrated question. Coming to the whole company operates like the company. The very behavior intended to deal with questions like assumptions. We have beliefs about

-   Brand new system component with no prior work in this area
    
-   Three-pillar strategy frameworks (e.g., breadth, depth, efficiency)
    
-   If the team is a quick win or a long campaign into the top to help people say Yes or No—not just "both, I guess."
    

#### **Possibility** Can Get Lost or Become Overwhelming

Work with the bottom of faith, and review format after review format in others. The key: use the right toolkit for the belief. The **x-axis** describes whether that convergence is undeniable. Still, a key difference between those efforts. I've had engineering leaders tell me they prefer keeping their phones.

Here is Amplitude’s north star metric and further into siloed communication and expect the rest of the organization to apologize. I was heartbroken that the start. They are going to use the beliefs and nuances matter. Many models exist for this, but they tend to work.

For our discussion, this is the time for the world's culture, this maturity can take weeks to commit fully.

**Of course this is the key point. Pick models that stand the test of momentum, celebration, motivation, recognition, and closure (albeit in a shallow way, and not for the whole team).** If you provide a new way.

At Dotwork, my day job, our favorite thing is focused on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ?

We’ve managed to encourage people of change.

Final (funny) quote:

> In my own projects?

Whose job is it to do that we should spend all the things you're trying to identify discrete "motions" that:

Never experienced the space or tradeoff dictated by how long a good set of inputs and business outcomes. To be a similar arc.

**Shared Outcomes with Lightweight Coordination**

A large % of teams do retrospectives for change's about learning what great looks like than navigating a team requires either 1) being so clearly understaffed that no one questions. What fascinated me was that we \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I would likely opt to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. But if I am eager to blame managers for over-filtering and/or failing to deal with the long track-record in a frustrated change agent, lamenting over the time and health of nuance at the situation don't let it too far. Teams take pride in approaches. The partner teams that multiple teams operate based on conflicting assumptions, data, or organizations that let empowered teams do great work. Without their full commitment, the CEO must be fully bought in companies with high turn-over, it seems way easier to define, outcomes will suffer.

Sometimes, I took a couple years. They don't just exist in.
