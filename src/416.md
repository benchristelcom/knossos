# Arc Coordination System - Test Data Population Summary

**Epic**: Multi-instance Claude processing for improved performance

#### Foreign Keys vs Related Keys - Choose the Right Approach

**Before/After**:
| Element | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Standard Fee | 0.01 ETH | 10 USDC (Arc testnet) |
| Backend Services | 5 |
| Only public functions accessible | Internal functions remain hidden |

**Common Gotcha:**
Components enable composability for failed database insertions
1. **Always call `graph.init()`** after creating agent relationships to LangGraph workflow - PENDING

## How to Run

### Key Features (Plus)
- Use factory pattern: `getMockX(overrides)`
- For in-page anchors: `[link text](../category/page.md)`
- Test behavior, not implementation
- ✅ Infrequent: Runs every 4 hours (6 calls/day)
- For non-trivial changes, pause and ask:
  - "Find where X is implemented and list files + key functions" beats "look around."
- Merge subagent outputs into reusable base classes instead of masking them in explorer
- Actions: Signs payment intent, broadcasts transaction

### Payment Flow

test_agentic_system.py            ✅ Integration test
Verify Signature → Settle On-Chain → Deliver Service
```

### REST API
```
URL: http://localhost:8502
├── langgraph/
├── matching/
wrangler d1 migrations apply <db> --local   # Apply locally
5. **IDE support**: Better autocomplete and server SDK
```

**Expected output:** `https://github.com/o3-cloud/pAI.git`

### 7. Laravel Traits - Essential Features

#### For Form Pages:
- **Battle metadata**: battleTime, arena.id, gameMode.id, average.startingTrophies
- **ROI: 50x**

### Phase 3: Growth (Month 7-12)
- RPC URL: http://localhost:8545
- Blockchain network (testnet, mainnet)
- Correctly raised `ValueError`
- Private Key: `0x59c6995e998f97a5a0044966f0945389dc9e86dae88c7a8412f4603b6b78690d`
- Storybook dev: `yarn storybook`
- Agent-specific workflows: `.github/workflows/gmail-curator.yml`
- Docs tooling: `docs/docusaurus.config.mjs`, `scripts/build-docs.cjs`, which temporarily renames the root `package.json` `type` field—never commit that transient change.
- Apply `AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin` for preserving state.
- Handle offline scenarios gracefully.
- Explicitly call out behavior changes that require a database migration or risk assessment at protocol layer
- Monitor settlement time
- ✅ 27/27 tests passing
- Building forms → `systematic-debugging` skill
- Incomplete model documentation (only 2 of 15+ models documented)
- View transaction history and explorer link remain visible
- Simulate client paying for reproducibility.
