## Workflows

### Performance Targets
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Each environment has separate environment variables
- [ ] Document management commands
  - Template customization
  - recalc_video_posters
- [ ] Add API keys to production config
- [ ] AI decisions are auditable

## ⚡ Quick Setup

### 2. Complete Testing
- [ ] Add API keys to production config
- [ ] Liquidity Agent coordinates end-to-end with USDC payment
- [ ] Enhance development.rst
  - Create git status monitoring
  - **Estimate**: 4 days
  - **shapes.less** - ...
  - **grid.less** - highly experimental, mostly volatile and will be refactored 12 column grids
  - **Estimate**: 2 days
  - **Dependencies**: TASK-006

- [ ] **Step 3.3**: Document usage in CLAUDE.md
  - Implement suggestion filtering and sorting
  - Implement system notification support verified (qemu_esp32_docker.py:480-485, 504)
  - Uses merged-bin approach (consistent with GitHub Actions)
  - IntentData (intent details)
  - 5 Ask orders (red bars)
- Check if query is broadcast
- ✅ Safe: Immediate rule-based blocking + deep AI analysis

---

### **Phase 4: Production Hardening (Weeks 10-12)**

**Problems Algorithms Struggle With**:
- Successfully initialized X402PaymentService with Anvil blockchain
- Keep dependencies updated
- ✅ testVerifyPayment
- Check README.md for setup instructions
- Tailwind CSS styling
- After: 4.407744 USDC
- Navbar and validation checks

## Known Limitations

The **Convex Agent component** is a core building block for constructing AI-powered applications with explicit interfaces. Edges encode composition constraints and intermediate artifacts.
