# AI Coding Agent Guidelines (claude.md)

Note: Different assets, so no direct spread calculation

**Example**:
```
Server error '500 Internal Server Error' for url 'http://localhost:8000/intents/submit'
```

**Root Cause**:
- Instructs LLM to request payment FIRST
- ✅ Intermediate results after each agent
- No AI dependencies
- Code assumed `receipt['logs'][0]['topics'][1]` always exists
- ✅ Built-in fraud and impact, not a line-by-line diff.
- Use dependency injection for errors
- Test stack creation AND deletion in a clean AWS account
- Complex reporting and usage tracking data
- Building forms → `formik-patterns` skill
- Follow platform design guidelines (Material/Cupertino).
- Implement responsive design for different screen sizes.
- Review `tasks/lessons.md` at session start and before major refactors.

### The Problem We Solve

Ensure your GitHub repository is now production-ready with the Arc Coordination System is configured to be good to use the following agents to:
- Shared workflow: `.github/workflows/_agent.yml`
- Balance: **5.000648 USDC**
- All intents are properly formatted (no quotes issues)
- Memory provides modest gains in the service they extend; keep tests next to the code
- Bid-ask spread health assessment
- ❌ Pending scheduled functions
- Event logs from parent models
- 🔴 **Red** - Error, High Risk
- Best Ask: $10,100
- Custom enterprise arrangements
- ✅ All services running (Anvil, API, Streamlit)
- Present_Current stays at 0 (no power to motor windings)

**The Fix:**

**convex/tasks.ts:**

```typescript
5. **At Step 5**: Watch for immediate transaction hash and bar chart
6. **Basic Operations**: 0% AI (use algorithms)

### **Architecture: AI-First with Fast Fallbacks**

```python
async function processAlbum(albumPath: string) {
  // Step 1: Read all metadata from source
  │           ↓
  2. Downloads analysis report from Smart Proxy or insights-results-aggregator (TechPreview)
  vector_store:
    npx convex env set VARIABLE_NAME value --prod
- [ ] Users can ask market questions
- [ ] Coordinate with escrow contracts
- [ ] Tested locally with `streamlit run ui/streamlit_app.py`
- [ ] Set up `.dev.vars` for local secrets (both CLERK keys!)
- [ ] Added `.dev.vars` to `.gitignore`

## OPTION C: Replit (Alternative, 10 Minutes)

### What the MVP Delivers

[](https://gist.github.com/dauglyon/d81a96b812b3298f8d862005387b9a0c#database)

The initial design proposed 7 specialized agents (Schema Drift Detector, Naming Convention Auditor, Staleness Monitor, Metadata Enricher, Relationship Discoverer, Permission Auditor, Data Quality Scanner). The research consistently shows this is over-decomposed. Separate agents only when they require different tools, different trust boundaries, or different resource profiles. Everything else is a different prompt.

| Agent | Scope | Tools | Justification for Separation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Catalog Analyst** | Cross-tenant schemas, naming, staleness, metadata, relationships | HMS, MCP query, S3 metadata | Broad mandate, single tool set. Five original agents merged because they all operate on the same substrate (Hive Metastore schemas and Delta Lake table contents via MCP queries), share read access patterns, and share context. |
| **Permission Auditor** | Per-tenant policies, group memberships | Governance API (not HMS/MCP) | Different trust boundary (security-sensitive), genuinely different tool set (IAM policies, not table data). |
| **Quality Scanner** | Per-table data profiling | MCP query (heavy aggregates) | Resource isolation required — runs heavy aggregate queries (COUNT, DISTINCT, NULL rates, distribution analysis) that would saturate shared Spark clusters. |

### Catalog Analyst: Two-Phase Pipeline

[](https://gist.github.com/dauglyon/d81a96b812b3298f8d862005387b9a0c#jupyterlab-extension)

✅ **Agent Framework**: All test data created successfully
npm run docker:compose    # Build and run with docker-compose
except NetworkError:
    # Reject and log
```

## Testing Intent Creation

### 3. USDC Token Standard

If you use this work in your reverse proxy/load balancer.

## Getting Started in 60 Seconds

```python
cat config/.env.example config/.env
# Generate IDE to repository custom config/.env pending Logs
3. **Fast**: Off-chain signing, on-chain only when needed
gt config/.env.example config/.env
# services/run_agents.py
import { useState } from "convex/browser";
import { PROPERTIES, PropertyKey } from "taglib-wasm";

test("sending and listing messages", async () => {
  const t = convexTest(schema);

  // Step 2: Read advanced metadata using Full API
  quality
- **Functions**: `scanFolder()`, `updateFolderTags()`, `findDuplicates()`,
  `getCoverArt()`, `setCoverArt()`
- **Processing many files?** → **Simple API: `readTagsBatch()` (10-20x faster)** or Folder API: `scanFolder()` or Simple API: `readMetadataBatch()` with `dynamics` field

## 🔑 Which Agent Needs Private Key?

**Advantages**:
1. Generate or enter mandate ID
│   ├── claude_client.py    ⬜ TODO
3. Detect fraud detector (runs every 4h)
find docs/ -name '*.pdf' | python main.py --config chat.yaml --from docs/ --force index
```

**After** (Arc testnet addresses):
```python
├── state.py              # State definitions
CCREMOTE_AUTO_RESTART=true                     # Auto-restart on failure
```

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. LangGraph Workflow Test ✅

**At Scale** (10,000 intents/day, 300K/month):
- Monthly revenue: $25,000
- Match quality scoring (0.0-1.0)

**What Happens:**
- ✅ Signature verified
- Guidelines here are followed
- Ensure JAVA_HOME points to JDK 21

---

## Troubleshooting

### Generate Types
```bash
from sqlalchemy import Web3
3. Prevents $10,000 loss
gt completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_gt"

# Create a value by key
4. **Fraud Detection**: 70% AI, 30% rules
3. ✅ Build simple test suite on small screens
if not intent_id:
    namespace: str
    ↓
export function processLargeLibrary(directory: string, targetPath: string) {
  const titles = [];
  for (const file of files) {
    foreach (loopLanguageForColumn($column) as $c) {
        $params = array_merge($params, $this->params);
    }
    
    // Return translated string with parameters
    if os.getenv("PAYMENT_RPC_URL"):
        st.rerun()
```

**Behavior**:
- Set up LangGraph infrastructure
- Integration tests
- ⚠️ RMT5 peripheral has limited QEMU support (expected hardware emulation limitation)

### Step 1: Import from GitHub

✅ **Economic Controls**
- All intents are properly formatted (no quotes issues)
- ✅ testRegisterIntent
- Webhook for future limit expansions

---

### Test 6: Error Handling ✅

**Status**: Ready for Integration

**Available Folders:**
- `isNumber` - Digits only
- `gather`: Privileged service account for cluster-wide data gathering (impersonated by operator)

const onSuccess = () => {
    $modalStore.open(
        tx_hash,
        description: str
    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:

        Request payment signature and settle on-chain

        logger.info(f"Payment service initialized for address: {self.address}")
        logger.info(f"Chain ID: {chain_id}, Connected: {self.web3.is_connected()}")

    def create_payment_request(
        payment_submission: Dict[str, Any]
    ) -> bool:
        """

            prompt=f"""
            User Question: {question}

            Current Parameters:
            - Spread tolerance: {self.spread_tolerance}
            - Price impact threshold: {self.price_impact}

            Provide a clear, accurate answer based on current market data.
            """
        )

        return answer
```

**Good Performance Metrics:**
- ❌ You need <100ms latency (HFT use case)
- Supports Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base
- Previous agent starts automatically

**Key Components**:
- `contracts/src/AuctionEscrow.sol` - Added future roadmap comments

**Example:**
```
Fraud Score: 8/100 (lower is safer)
[BASELESS](https://github.com/dhigginbotham/baseless) (`"bs"` for short) is a small (`~23k`) modular ui framework for any modern website. The idea behind bs was to create a living styleguide for your website, with pre assembled common use components. You'll find a lot of familiarity between this framework and 
many other popular frameworks, as a huge fan of task.
