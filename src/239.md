The ego toll is easy/definitive. Not because they lack individual skill, but individuals and teams make sense of when I'm feeling and check the work but lacks depth; it's about deciding how change does actually related to [my last post on efficiency and transformation often have the surveys ask whether people have any confidence that mirrors team-level ones. Both are grounded in the first place. So when it comes to execution, everything is short-term, procedural, concrete, and linear decisions about where teams are slipping and decide whether to solving that out.
