# CRITICAL: ARCHON-FIRST RULE - READ THIS FIRST
  artifacts and logs when triaging issues locally.

## Third parties

- TypeScript, 2-space indentation, single quotes, trailing commas.
- Protect against common vulnerabilities (XSS, injection attacks).
- Path aliases for new functions:
  ```python
  2. Use app HTTP response codes (302 = running, 500 = error)
- **Builder Patterns**: `/configuration/src/agents/Agent.ts`, `/inkeep-chat/src/agents/Agent.ts`, `/inkeep-chat/src/agents/Agent.ts`, `/inkeep-chat/src/agents/Agent.ts`, `/inkeep-chat/src/handlers/executionHandler.ts`
- **Bytecode**: 2942 bytes
- **Automatic invocation**: LLM decides when to search
- **Key features**:
  - Frontend: `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` (Next.js) or `import.meta.env.VITE_CONVEX_URL` (Vite)
  - Creates counterparty automatically
  - Implement dependency validation interface
  - Plan notification preferences and filtering
  - **Dependencies**: TASK-002

- [ ] **TASK-019**: Design profiler UI
  - Design template creation wizard
  - Security best practices
- [ ] Documentation added to `/agents-docs/`
- [ ] All linting passes (`pnpm lint`)

### Cluster Transfer Management
4. ✅ Test matching with escrow funding
npm run dev          # Start dev server at http://localhost:8000/health

# Instead of os.getenv()
await $helper.alertSuccess({ message, callback })  
await $helper.alertWarning({ message, callback })
await $helper.alertError({ message, callback })

// Examples:
1. **Already coordinates settlements** - Natural fit for payment completion (webhook in production)
echo "org.gradle.parallel=true" >> ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
```

## Contact Number Handling - MANDATORY Patterns

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Use dedicated payment wallet
- [ ] Configure `PAYMENT_PRIVATE_KEY` in production
- [ ] 85% match success rate (vs 50% algorithmic)
- [ ] <3s average processing time
- [ ] Run integration test with USDC
- [ ] Audit payment flow on testnet first
- [ ] 90% parsing success
- [ ] Configured build command (npm run build)
- [ ] Fetched and verified current Convex documentation
- [ ] Analytics data can be imported/exported for sharing

### 3. My Intents (📋)
**Purpose**: Detect suspicious patterns and fraud

```typescript
3. ✅ Validate AI reasoning quality

---

### **Use Case 2: Intelligent Negotiation** (HIGH VALUE)

**What needs an LLM (~30-40%):**

-   Generating suggested descriptions from column names and sample data
-   Batch output — LLM returns structured JSON, parsed and validated; unparseable output is logged and discarded

### Language

* ❌ `tree` - NOT INSTALLED, use `fd` instead
* To save main context space, for code searches, inspections, troubleshooting or analysis, use code-searcher subagent where appropriate - giving the subagent full context background for the task(s) you assign it.
* For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.
* NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
* NEVER proactively create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
* If you create any temporary new files, scripts, or helper files for iteration, clean up these files by removing them at the end of the task(s) you assign it.
* If you create any temporary new files, scripts, or helper files for iteration, clean up these files by removing them at the end of the task.
* When you update or modify core context files, also update markdown documentation and memory bank
* Before you finish, please verify your solution
* To save main context space, for code searches, inspections, troubleshooting or analysis, use code-searcher subagent where appropriate - giving the subagent full context background for the task(s) you assign it.
* ALWAYS read and understand relevant files before proceeding. Use your thinking to plan and iterate based on this new information, and then take the best next action.
* After completing a task that involves tool use, provide a quick summary of what you've done.
* ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
* ALWAYS read and understand relevant files before proposing code edits. Do not speculate about code you have not inspected. If the user references a specific file/path, you MUST open and inspect it before explaining or proposing fixes. Be rigorous and persistent in searching code for key facts. Thoroughly review the style, conventions, and abstractions of the codebase before implementing new features or abstractions.
* Ignore CLAUDE.md and CLAUDE-*.md files
* Before you finish, please verify your solution
* ❌ `ls -R` - use `rg` instead
* ❌ `find` - use `fd` or `rg --files`
* ❌ `cat file | grep` - use `rg pattern file`

### Step 5: Test Deployed App

For PRs to `rlm` core:
```bash
export const get = query({
  args: { userId: v.id("users"), amount: v.string() },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // db.insert() returns the new document's ID
    self.payment_service = self._init_payment_service()

2. [Payer] Sign and broadcast transaction on Arc testnet. All smart contracts are deployed, verified, and ready for testing. Users can now create intents, match orders, and settle trades with full on-chain transparency.
