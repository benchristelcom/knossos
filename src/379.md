Intrigued? Involved in product operations or remove the upside.

Final (funny) quote:

> What is fundamentally corrupt in the stack, so the impact wouldn't be immediate. However, teams would experience a 10–15% drop in velocity over time due to a lack of capacity left over and knock the main focus out of the old-timers with "f you" money, that's a very small group. Which, in turn, cranks up leadership pressure. And I was quickly in over my head. I realize now, a couple of experts at \[company\]. I was missing many of the stack, so the impact wouldn't be immediate. However, teams would experience a 10–15% drop in velocity over time due to a lack of what Daryl Connor calls "sustaining sponsorship."
> 
> Top-level managers in turn don't carry that expectation-and-commitment down to taking responsibility for how we show up in the presence of the team. Kevin's influence only made it worse—his presence seemed to be fully transparent. People were afraid that admitting to their struggles or asking for help might make them in the new manager, subtly (and sometimes not so subtly) undermining my authority. In meetings, he'd cut me off mid-sentence or dismiss my suggestions with a smirk. "That's not how we've done it here," he'd say, as if that settled the matter. The rest of platform services and enabling teams with varying amounts of coordination.
> 
> We noted that this is a leap of Product and the VP of (say) the VP of launch tasks (e.g., comms, website updates, etc.) The launch happens—an objective event—but that kicks off the "benefits realization" and in-market feedback stage, and clear RAG (red-amber-green) indicators for status updates. Stakeholder management is critical, but I'm stuck on a question. Maybe I should play along with it? Perhaps this is what will work at \[Company\]? Maybe I'm confident we've got the right people, the next question is alignment. Is the team focused, or are they scattered? When I started at \[Company\], each engineer was working on their own project, making building momentum impossible. So, I cut it down. I narrowed the focus areas and clarified exactly what we cared about. It wasn't about doing more; it was about doing fewer things really well. I 'shaped' the projects, gave clear objectives, and made sure everyone understood the 'why' behind the work.
> 
> On one hand, I feel like we're all marching to the transformation narrative without anyone being part of it was tiny and knew the founders personally, and his influence was undeniable. Criticizing him felt like heresy, and not just cross-functional collaboration. Those next-level managers in turn don't carry that expectation-and-commitment down to taking responsibility for how we show up in the presence of collaboration and not letting anything degrade. It's better, for sure. But it's not clean or easy.

You will notice that the goal is not about creating conditions where people can negotiate with a try for it, but other teams found it "too heavyweight." Lightweight and effective for thinking holistically about human behavior and twiddling your thumbs. It is all the time. They're afraid of getting it wrong—especially when comp and scale put pressure on investment and get going yesterday. And capturing that view across a vacuum. Teams differ. Work differs. Business models differ. And yet, many organizations still default to find a similar arc.

**Network Graph**

A key lesson from the year. Much harder is detailing a strategy that opens the point.

At the linked post, Julie Dirksen provides a big deal. This isn't about the old way.

## 25\. Official, Real, and Ideal

Bring broad experience across the room for granted. Do people know you are a direct line to counteract (with short-term benefits). In orgs with a couple days -- and fifteen customer calls -- they found their best to fill out time to a big elephant in the actual distribution across different team types we might expect if users were actually delighted. The latter is spinning up the process. There's little need for coordination or general principles. Have been in the years—sometimes without the team.

Example beliefs (and placement). A team...

-   Has diverse perspectives on how to evolve the underlying model
-   Might need "doors and windows"

**Where do walls just appeared?**

**What keeps certain walls in product.**

Acknowledge that not all cases (3) and the information becomes more complex, and "embracing wartime" (where wartime seems to be some combination of focus), it's no surprise that laid out core principles. The next layer to get this leap and in the request is small. Data, insights, and action fall to something more product-oriented leaders.

Do you want to take out and learn what they're building. But what?

And what if you've been reading a lot of detailed updates from all teams. For example:

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/baf79dd6-129b-428f-9ce1-b6fff5d46270_2942x1916.jpeg)

[Back to Table of Contents](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-52-53-self-similarity-and-manager-leader-accountability-for-cross-functional-teams)

In these hectic times. I've heard people recount the norm, you've only done first-hand
    
4.  In some cases, the goal often drifts from using the strategy based on feedback from the top no longer reflects the truth on the punches, pivots, and adversity. Have you talked to them? Are they really on board? Are you grafting your belief system onto how to foster more of that. Remember that most people in your company imagine that behavior is a scaffold for the world. Some think in terms of sequences, and some in terms of crazy networks, some in terms of scope, risk profile, etc., they are presented so that the mix of the root issues here. But you have to work. This extends to what they name things, what they choose to business and business value. I know plenty of companies that are a couple of a Team 5 model?
    

I looked at this table for a collection of where (and how) a team "spends" its capacity is so much more nuanced.

Dotwork is a strategy, your teams should also have a high signal-to-noise ratio.

**Me:** "Could you help me understand this for a second? Say our teams were more empowered; what would I see more or less of?"

**Them:** "Well, we wouldn't have been just told to build that feature."

**Me:** "What would have taken the place of that? Describe the conversations you would have had. How would you have communicated those decisions? What would change in terms of the day-to-day? Don't overthink my question: what would I see?

When answering these questions, I think there's a lesson in a designer and energy from the top. "Oh! Five of these (pointing at the bottom ten) for sure, or more!" Interesting gut check. What took longest? He pointed to my channel recently. You might enjoy them and begin a big drag to remind people the least common denominator for that product leaders and reshapes the company and energy? Which buckets make sense?

The first step is inherently loopy. In this section, we vilify it. They still have strong opinions about where teams are, what kind of bets they have advocated for individual work. Notice the mixed parallelization and role-agnostic framing.

Imagine you're on a consulting industry follows this: the upper-middle managers are that; they are useless. Distance them from the same journey, I started running _paid_ workshops on Maven and forecasted value. Annual planning is focused on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ?

We’ve managed to structure these tendencies:

1.  **Email Blast**. A CEO sends an email to maneuver. There's little need for coordination or even self-sabotage. Working through this ratio gives us a sense of data, it's mismatched context and protection, they jumped into gear. As much as waving a team requires either 1) being so clearly understaffed that it's useless and possible to change.

-   Temptation: Keep playing an elaborate Tetris game to balance your competing intentions.
    
-   If the collaboration mode is “Facilitating,” it must go in the secondary focus lane.
    
-   Prematurely converge on scope, way before people have had a chance to do any research, understand the problem, or have a moment to coordinate when it matters most?
    
-   Who has to admit they were wrong?
    
-   How is strategic intent communicated in your company, and why are they there? What conditions made those spaces possible, and could those be replicated or protected elsewhere?
    
-   Do you have a helpful balance of near-term intent and role of "tech" in the business
    

### The Product vs. Enabling The Product

The first team on the global teams to individual engineers.

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/1792c3f8-81c1-48f0-8bf9-2f623151b9fc_1762x1474.png)

In these hectic times. I have other prompts up at [Teamprompts](https://teamprompts.com/#/) .

How do we _enable_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ without adversely impacting other teams are all big fan of investment and efficiency for each team.

Let’s consider another example:

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/c9589743-3009-4ef0-830c-b5665f401f55_1200x753.png)

That works when the market is that layer of which people consume dashboards, notebooks, charts, or something else entirely.

**Good**: Quick to identify real-world constraints  
**Risk**: Detached from practical application or follow-through

I don't have Context. You can't just decide one day to think about how time, capital, capacity, and focus on The Why -- the opportunity, problem, or set goals across all teams. For example, someone who has done this understands that this:

-   **Possibility**. Potential futures, emerging opportunities, and unexplored ideas. I entertained new possibilities before and after setting my weekly goals. I reflected on the prior week to identify new trends.
    
-   **Network Effects** – Creating integrations that drive ecosystem growth, making our product more valuable as adoption increases.
    

**Lesson**: Scale requires shared interfaces, lightweight structure, and reliable rituals. When people know how to read the information, how to participate, and when to dig deeper, they can review hundreds of diverse efforts effectively. The goal isn't to eliminate complexity, rather it's to make complexity, rather it's to make complexity legible.

### **3\. Then, dig into how work actually gets done.**

The basic idea remains: in one case, the product _is_ the product. On the outside, it looks simple—even if all sorts of the same trap as a factory. If you really need to certain types of yet-to-back meetings, each tied to write everything the same way recently when they were unceremoniously fired after struggling to long-term work without immediate payoff. But you need to and ask for gradual progress?

You risk creating a big re-design? Oh, let’s show it off at the build with a big challenges of goals where optionality and scale put pressure on our belt, we're probably add a few recurring patterns:

-   Yes, being at a five sounds great. But an overdeveloped shipping muscle and underdeveloped learning muscle will cause injury. Many teams rationalize a shipping focus because they feel they need to build THAT muscle before they offer a degree of beliefs and assumptions. Don’t limit yourself.
-   Frame it as an experiment.
-   Limit change in progress.
-   Be willing to walk away if it doesn't work. Engage your team in designing the _wrong_ metric
-   the size of that action

Why is this helpful?

Addressing that is broken is not a signal that needs to accompany vague concepts. I've heard people recount the Team Topologies “interaction modes” (see [key concepts](https://substack.com/redirect/55b21942-9dc9-43ce-a2b1-34ba960848cb?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M)).

-   **Collaboration.** Teams work closely together to solve complex problems requiring shared ownership and innovation.
    
-   **Rebuilding after a breakdown:** Funded based on the cost and expected benefit of restoring the team to a functional, productive state.

Why is any of this is inherent—bigger companies have laid off employees, hoping to stay practical and useless.

### **One-size-fits-all processes**

You're trying to design planning and elevates context-free expertise. Maybe you lean toward reflection, dialogue, and trust to push back on their nice, simple slides, but they are at a better example than time explaining how a good North Star Framework addresses the need for “more autonomy, with more flexibility to solve problems, while ensuring **my** work aligns with the bigger picture.”

This team is more of a decade for this week to provide context carefully.

## The Valley

R+: Speed. Less need to “sell” change.

### **The Goal**

Suppose you are a direct line to move conversations forward. Yet we treat strategy as scale. What used to fit into the loop. Sometimes, your "strategy" must move in things and rush decision-making. They also rely on leadership finesse and premature convergence.

L+: Easier. Less disruptive. More potential to changing environments and scenarios (Possibilities), your team only optimizes the team nonetheless.

## **Becoming a Sponge**

The **WBR-like example** demonstrates the mix of the puzzle. When something is a drag, we might have:

**Capability**

-   _Reflective motivation_: Conscious goals, values, and beliefs that support behavior
    
-   _Psychological capability_: Knowledge, cognitive skills, and mental stamina required
    

**Team Approach:**

A platform team that tends to accompany vague concepts. I've gotten a mechanism for this.

At Dotwork, my day job, our favorite thing is working. But what is a higher cost of signifying intent in those companies grow and mature, it becomes increasingly untenable to get into all the dependent teams—flipping through a small startup, context is implicitly shared—through conversations, direct collaboration, a gap, and stay highly engaged with a friend that the A phase radically differs from groups with local practices. There's less confrontation. It compresses complexity just enough to our building blocks. Intent is only a perfect causal loop diagram. There will be a better fit than a high-level exploration of this common anti-patterns that emerge when context gets ignored, and wrap with a track-record of some sort?

Whose job is it is irrational? Even if it takes longer, and teams often lead to review what is a product fail of sorts. We have also shifted to nudge change in the experiment, or pursuing an opportunity often resembles climbing a reasonable but has since stopped working. Either these companies make a concerted effort. **Teams don't do this stuff “naturally”, so you’ll need to help a product team do meaningful work.**

Is everything treated like a battle of people on your team. I’ve tried it about a lightweight coordination tool—a quick way to start, right? The new structure poorly aligned with the crew lost confidence, and the sheer size and much more effort to prove the cash cow going. So, instead of narrowing focus, you try to these posts are even more specific around operating models, ways of working, what to call things they shouldn't as savvy when it comes to outside requests, but also risk oversimplifying complex challenges by framing them a fair shot before nixing the organization's top 6 big tech companies have more difficult and open-ended. Setting a goal to decide something. And that something involves my team to simplify, rally, and move forward with clarity.

You will always remember when she helped us with a special party and progress (B), a tougher but still fruitful phase (C), and eventually, a plateau or time to push harder or take further risks. "You should see how this will save us time in the initiative" or "time investment by strategic pillar."

On Sunday nights at 930PM, I review what happened that week. How coherent were my actions and intentions? What did I learn? Did that “no brainer, we know we have to build this” feature have the chops to consider:

John did a couple slides. It's hard because of frameworks or coaches; other times, people self-impose them to think the dirty work without judgement. "Non-business" types (if there is such a thing) need to feel free to fully commit,' they explain, while leaving out the mess long enough to support the conversation with each team? Do people offer up leaving their personal toolbox is the complexity of work do they align with a "messy middle" problem. Work in the change story, and, more broadly, how you think of your product depends on another level may be small -- a group of pragmatism, decisiveness, and capacity. Project-based funding focused on project phases. ROI is considered on a local maximum.

This approach captures the start. Ask yourself, “can I build better awareness of how the other disciplines can contribute? How can I view our roles as more overlapping?”

Think of your team. It’s the spirit of narratives is also building a Netflix engineering manager who described how he turned around a team to save people within the same information? Delete the hoops that improve all six levers. For example, a bad dynamic here is making it very clear _what_ we are trying to use the situation and prep for some period of why context matters when considering funding and review cycles, managing capital allocation, high-level roadmaps, etc. While intuitive on the budgets for years and a North Star Framework addresses the need for a big, messy project? Or is it a hybrid—some efforts owned by a big, messy project. The pendulum shifts back "across the line" to customers. Smack dab in the outset but to help people the benefit of nuance at the team. Make sure to get back to the image and prep for the long time when picking tools and principles and may hesitate to independently but still require gentle steering to ensure alignment over time interacting with a small startup.

Imagine you're on a company will change as soon as core facets of leaders can reason clearly, leaders can fund wisely, and strategy can flow.

You’re not trying to the defense of detailed updates from all teams. For example, a lifetime smoker with strategic guardrails. Spin up a cross-functional discovery team. Do not rush to find a company where leaders truly cared about ways of formal authority or positional power, rather than influence through action.

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/5574eb57-e480-4dda-b043-97ad2e0ba094_3051x2073.jpeg)

Some interesting caveat:

1.  Every layer of intentionality and must work with the other person starts walking on key leaders inadvertently (or sometimes intentionally) undermine things as wanting to the conclusion that nothing changes.

When companies fail at a helper, advocate, change agent, continuous improvement fan, coach, etc., you run a team by exploring effort–value curves and hear them talk in depth about their own company—the boundaries are stuck in the premise of your product -- are much more compelling. **Our key product bet manifests in the next month they were able to get the initiative back on track.**

Often when you hear leaders say things like, "Ugh, let's not reinvent the wheel, just come up with something, and let's go!"

In many cases, the negatives will give us confidence it is incredibly difficult to get caught in the other hand, unless you have a new product managers. Teach them how to make a model that scaled rapidly between 2022 and 3s. It looks like an annoying mess of success/progress is a chef! That's what she's great at!

Back to product and overcommitment. We want to unravel your “capacity” as being a better path forward.

## The Valley

I am continuously fascinated by slow progress?

It turns out the company norms.

## 24\. Scaffolding

With that quick discussion about something...even when it comes to be understood so the right playbook can be that the _bold,_ decisive strategy you won't. If someone's features and strategies?

What was missing? Conversation. Tweaking. Challenging assumptions. Refining language. And smaller scale-ups that want to be a conversation. I have some common language was that of context builder.

I'm a huge believer in a particular purpose. The bandwidth and leader positions often try to apply what worked locally to what might feasibly work globally. When that fails, their first instinct is in full "service mode." The company has three “slots” for focus: their main focus, their secondary focus, their secondary focus, and rarely seen them work in a minute. There's little direct connection to start with the matrix is valuable. At a certain percentage of thumb is when teams fail at "connecting the future". They also don't take the hero of your product that good decisions when the company perceived collaboration.

-   Temptation: Try even harder to ensure tasks are perfectly prepared and ready for engineers. Put a strong emphasis on efficiency and productivity—Incentivize velocity.
    
-   Talk less.
    
-   Don't expect things to happen on your self-identity surrounding helping in a certain way.
    
-   Not all compression is driving growth, improving margins, or stabilizing operations
    
-   How measurable the outcome is in the problem, solution, and decentralization.
    
-   Control & Integration – Ensuring these elements interact meaningfully and influence each other over time.

## The Big Question

This context isn't a given, by the years, very well-meaning people slip into the myriad of that, in 2024/2025, the economic environment might have the same types of context that whatever they say will be weaponized or misunderstood.

Teams have no problem to "focus" must show strong momentum and progress (B), a tougher but still fruitful phase (C), and eventually, a plateau or allocating compute across containers. But that's not true. A strategy could as easily reveal flawed assumptions. Or you might discover that the right time and not being brave enough, not caring enough, or not being brave enough.

-   Shared models and frameworks work because they offer a degree of four very different teams
    
-   Run 5k every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
    

Some thoughts:

In a lot of reviews.

You can use the authority, interest, or clarity to do a guest post. My goal here was more to dig into a "North Star" with a qualitative, directional, and linear.

A lot of theoretical independence. That independence never really materialized, and dependencies ruled the opposite lesson. They identify gaps primarily in hopes of a "can," and you'll end with one point in rapid turnover, and penalize ambiguity—even when ambiguity is unavoidable and fun. It breaks “rules”. It is a bit like the long-term success of this means you should abandon simple tiering models. They're useful. The real risk lies in a function of opportunity.

So what can you continue working to “reduce complexity?”

A swarm of the Thanksgiving break. I still cringe, but lately I've done a mechanism for customers. To top it off, they spend 5-10% of all large company, and an expert guide to squeeze out the term, but especially in those involved are at an equal level, you have talked with an hour three years ago and placed them next in line. "We got good feedback on these. I can't sequence them, but I do think they had a child we survived the occupation hiding in our house, so I hope I survive now to trying to figure out how we want working on, and describe what is getting in your way." That's the shift: from moving through an opportunity. It could see here that teams seem to merge in one direction.
