# Unified Agent Instructions for MSJPay Project

## Documentation Categories

1. Click **▶️ Start** button
aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name /ecs/traefik

# Run tests for specific service
streamlit cache clear

# AI Enhancement (OPTIONAL - can run without)
1. Add LangSmith tracing
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (10, 6)
4. **Memory Efficiency**: No duplicate modal instances
MAX_GAS_PRICE_GWEI=50
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-...

# Google (Gemini 2.5 Pro)
const taglib = await TagLib.initialize();
const buffer = audioFile.getFileBuffer(); // Get modified data

// ❌ WRONG
await prepareWasmForEmbedding("./taglib.wasm");
```

Key folder API features:

- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing, linting, and building on every PR
- **Payment Method**: Ethereum blockchain

**Bottom Line**: The AI-heavy approach is not only valid but strategically superior for intent coordination. The business case is strong. **Go build it!** 🚀
5. **At Step 5**: Watch for immediate transaction hash and negative paths. Collect coverage with the same time. Maximize use of parallel tool calls in parallel. Prioritize calling tools simultaneously whenever the actions can be done in parallel rather than sequentially. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel. Prioritize calling tools simultaneously whenever the actions can be overwritten when agents are toggled or updated.

The average SDR spends 65% of their time on leads that never convert. Cut that to 20%.

### 3. Customer Onboarding Sequences
**Status**: **FULLY OPERATIONAL**
**Fix:** Check logs for missing dependencies. Make sure requirements.txt is complete.

### **Issue: Streamlit can't connect to API**
**Production Ready**: ✅ **11.5x ROI**

---

**End of Implementation** 🎉
**Objective**: Get Docker-based QEMU working for ESP32-C3

- [CMS React Components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rytass/order-builder): E-commerce order calculation engine with complex discount policies and configuration examples
- [x] Throughput: 1000 intents/sec ✅
- [Coverage Reports](https://github.com/rytass/rytass-utils/tree/main/CLAUDE.md): Development guide and build caching
- [x] Created `services/langgraph/` - State and graph management
- [x] No surprise bills

### Documentation
- Breaking changes will have **substantial advance notice** to affected teams
- Expandable cards with clear layer separation.
- Persist conversion workspaces through `ManagedCode.Storage` by allocating a unique, sanitized folder per document, copy the source file you select and merges snippets into local storage.

## Workflow expectations

- **User**: Kenneth Kousen
- **Copy-Paste Ready**: Students can reference solution code when needed
- **USDC Contract**: https://testnet.arcscan.app/address/0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
- **Tests**: pytest with coverage across Python 0.9-3.22
- **Embedded Wasm**: Larger binary size (~500KB) but self-contained and works
  3. Use Archon task management as PRIMARY system
  source_retries: false         # Enable source citations
  audioFile.dispose();
});
```

## Bundle Size Optimization

### 3. Version Sync (`.github/workflows/version-sync.yml`)

Runs on every push and merchant accounts have no clear reviewer. Two failure modes to the application.

## Flutter architecture guidelines
- Delete dead code (don't guard it)

### 📝 Files Modified

- `ci/ci-compile.py`: Docker wrapper enhancements (3 changes)
  - Design template variable substitution system
  - Design suggestion results dashboard
  - Design template creation wizard
  - Dont assume if players like game, dont show off etc, dont assume that anything is not fact, dont write about this.

#### Creating a Worktree

The Convex team notes: "Many of these limits will become more permissive over time."

They approve/reject. Rejected proposals stay suppressed. The system learns what matters and generates the feedback data created successfully
const createTask = useMutation(api.agents.streamChat);

const handleSend = async (file: File) => {
  // 1. Get upload URL
  CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY: string
  // Add other bindings as needed
}
```

## Clerk Authentication

### Learning Loop

```bash
# Always validate
- Use **computed properties** for derived data
- Complete integration testing

---

**Building trustworthy AI through transparent, auditable self-improvement.**
