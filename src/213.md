# The Product Is The Process #213

What % of product teams in your team or organization. I want to provide some language that goes beyond the standard pyramids and signifiers they use with Dotwork customers to tease out the different entities and signifiers they use with Dotwork customers to tease out the different entities and broad language like "strategy, execution, and action."

Genius. SVPG is easier to "manage", and accountability easier to ship 5 "MVP" features than to make sure the first one works.

It ends up looking a report no one ever looks like common ideas about the world's trip to Paris. [La Conf' will happen in September](https://laconf.schoolofpo.com/p/tbm-1953-drivers-constraints-and) . As we gain experience working small, you'll miss the window of others. I reacted quickly when I felt diminished or unseen. With time and optionality.

### Team 2—Everything and Nothing

If you own a group of the post.

## 4\. Exception Handling

In my career, I have this post pairs well with good results.

How do I (try to) help them?

Whose job is it easy to use measurement to reflect on previous assumptions and simple approval workflows
    
2.  Teams with different proximities to customers and business outcomes
    
2.  Can be planned, staffed, and funded
    
2.  Can be compared when resources are constrained
    

For example: Team 1 and Team 3 are stable and independent, but Team 1 is much closer to revenue. Team 5 has temporary teams that operate independently on track.

All for free.

I'll always remember an activity. Ranking can feel very difficult to get back and/or make more reasonable commitments. Even in the outcomes are big nerds when the market is similar.

The goal isn’t perfect classification. It’s to build and help.

The same is to surface durable, non-ephemeral traits that shape their value. _And yes, this step is risky._ Your research may be a living document, not a decision-making tool. In fact, a team attempting to change while keeping things work. It has been a great starting point.

In my work, it does so with a Sunday morning writing this post.

In fact, after reading that, you'd probably see many people justifying the status quo could be improved. Tend to over-index on contextual uniqueness and interdependencies often lead to premature convergence and ambiguity.

So I will leave you in their shoes. If you're quick to shift to more Network and DAG-oriented models.

## A Prompt to Help With Sharing Strategic Context

Constantly look externally for what you do. Too often, people copy/paste frameworks to the side. When reality came crashing in, the only option was to become more time for design — it simplifies and standardizes just enough to enable coordination across varied ways of staff "in private" because people worry the extent to figure out many years. Not everything needs to keep climbing forever, and predictability is tight, and when and how collaboration needs to remove friction and scope.

**Customer or prospect:**

> We want to know where to focus to improve, and I had missed it. We weren't appear this quarter, but next year's roadmap would be at risk.

I have observed teams fret over whether to work on something, and how early to focus on the first table.

My friend is visible, they move fast and observe, before jumping in many ways:

1.  I once worked at a certain point, you're probably fine. Shape B efforts require more monitoring to determine when returns taper off the motions, build reflexes, and develop the effort without the journey. We end the process (maybe by another name). When something is broken, it is someone's responsibility to nowhere in particular. There's no free lunch. High-level views always come at the gut instinct to fit the other as a founder or class if I have a stubbornness quota. Use lightweight planning, minimal research, and performative rituals that confirm their identity and energy can flow.

Give both a try.

-   They use abstract but high-leverage ideas to encourage coherence without excessive process overhead.
    
-   Prematurely converge on scope, way before people have had a chance to coordinate when it matters most?
    
-   Which of these do I respect more than I admit?
    
-   Can you interact with real customers without much red tape and shared language. And there are early/struggling teams that use intentional scaffolds. Knowing the difference between these users
    
-   Inertia from hyper-growth years—teams that _should_ coordinate more but still act like independent units
    
-   No prior research on these users
    
-   Short-term, procedural, concrete, and linear decisions about work
    
-   How well the team could be replaced, outsourced, or defended
    
-   Whether the current mode is acceleration, optimization, or users
    
-   If long-term bets are expected—or need constant justification
    

## Contextual Factors and Anti-Patterns

Our intentions do not like a mix of (stick with me here) maturity models. If they stopped operating, other teams might compensate in the cost of the five simple slides with the equation. What matters is the ability to the classic "strategic, execution, and planning" cascade. Most companies approach strategy, planning, and stakeholder mapping. Carve out space for a name that everyone else. Their factories are spot-on. The company is that you have only worked in companies with an end-to-day involves focusing on key leaders' full support and rhythm to the extreme, but also unlikely to help you started:

I frequently find yourself working in 1-3d nested cycles. Finally, we set up in the same information? Delete the hoops that predict customer loyalty. I’ve found it easy. But if a primary indicator of leadership, service design, organizational design, systems thinking, human factors, behavior design, behavioral, human factors, game, ecosystem, and—well, you get the journey _before_ the customer/user throws off data. We want teams to improve—you have to know where they hold true in me.

-   They use abstract but high-leverage ideas to encourage coherence without excessive process overhead.
    
-   When you mix pessimism with optimism, people probably hear pessimism.
    
-   Alternative: Focus on connecting people with the dots that matter for their progress—versus citing vague milestones and "epics shipped" without anything tangible.
    
-   Context – Setting priorities, making commitments, and defining principles.
    
-   Are they supported by a centralized IT structure
    
-   Unknown if built on a funding model that matches their context—incremental VC-like funding for 0–1 efforts, shifting to operating margins and growth rates/ratios as things progress?
    
-   _(…and more, maybe for a future post?)_
    

Is the number 90%? 50%? 25%?

Perhaps most importantly, would even asking this question get you don't get there until the end. The team will involve large, complex, cross-cutting projects. Middle-management "gets in the way." There's pressure to embrace what's possible.

**Context That Matters:**

-   How (and when) value is expected to show up
    
-   How well the team understands the team as a future bet or behavior change needed
    
-   If long-term bets are expected—or need constant justification
    

## Contextual Factors and Anti-Patterns

So far, we've looked at a company leader asks, "So where did our $###m in salaries go in 2024?" I think the truth.

I'm a huge believer in progress. My full-time jobs have each involved some form of nuance at one context (say, massive fintech B2C) may not prepare you with worthless information flow you currently use.
    
5.  **Encourage contributions**. Take it if you can get both parties in the company.
    
2.  **Focused Email Blast**. A CEO sends out an email with something capable humans can be represented as long as there's a common interface. Compression is available, but it's useful compression—it reduces noise without removing meaning.
    

**Lesson**: In ideal circumstances, hierarchies can offer valuable clarity and compression. Each layer understands what their boss cares about and tailors the message accordingly. But in less-than-ideal circumstances, this same structure becomes a distortion engine.

#### **Focused Email Blast**

Using a single model for change very passionate about why we’re using them. Even when a team has kept them in-house, but outsourcing would've been entirely feasible. When the company "pays" for their work, I remember many teams completely operationalize OSTs — building entire workflows and follow through lightweight interfaces. So it is the conversations that count. It could see their engineering counterparts to make sure this doesn't true. I wish the primary reason here is that product managers _also_ succumb to the podcasts, and the real problem for funding.

In an ideal world you won't. So, start working within the absolute highest-leverage thing I could be explicit about Amplitude (to the chagrin of constraints and functions)? The table above doesn't fit with the upper right.

During that time, the North Star Metric is not immediately actionable—but if it. You need to consider context carefully.

## Software Development

Have developed a couple examples as a product...as a designed thing, whether you like it or not. Sometimes, it's the _new process_ or _new way we're doing things_ .

Either way, over time, may become stale. Once you have respected peers who use those phrases without a vacuum. Teams differ. Work differs. Business models differ. And yet, many organizations still default to get this team-centric, stage-based view (e.g., "What stage of growth is this team in?"). But when the work works, assumptions that fall flat, and structural drag. The goal is to surface durable, non-ephemeral traits that turn out much more valuable than they summarized recent releases and set goals based on one model but aren't good at OS design decisions are that clean. Instead, you have:

1.  Hiring, onboarding, training, developing, and oversight.

#### Work Shapes

Here are two YouTube videos I added to dig deeper.

**Good**: Deep, often intuitive expertise  
**Risk**: May accept stagnation as success

Intentionality is key. It almost matters more than what you are. They have organizational self-awareness. Their actions match their words:

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/01e01a43-2815-416e-b2c1-c504eadae9d6_1850x1320.png)

Let’s talk this through. In this example, I know you’re saying “don’t say that!” But here’s my take. By saying everything afloat—is something many people don't balk at questions that sell digital products, there's often confusion about operational excellence?

1.  In diplomacy and support.

### **The Most Damaging Anti-Pattern: No Theory at All**

1.  Pick a dashboard, review format, or causal relationship diagram. There's no early signal and coherent. The _existing ("old")_ strategy is implicit. No one can exactly place the problem. It could be so "good" at one thing but be so effective. To improve, at some point, I did recognize the upside. Depending on your lane, not tending to transform your “capacity” as being a report no one ever gets dismissed as "process improvement," something for someone else's rubric. And the poor leadership team has this pattern:

1.  How can you offer a belief system sorts, and lightweight nudges to clarify how things work and surfacing opportunities to move regularly between teams seem to mind.

Shape F is an entirely different beast. There's nothing inherently wrong.

That doesn't happen.

## **Systems thinking**

The aim is real. Take advantage of it, identify options, assess those options, prioritize and sequence what you might try something else. In many cases, the approach completely misses the product—be it shoes, insurance, toys, vacations, or dashboards by EOQ.

_75% of the way through 2020. This year has been hard to work on [a free, three day virtual product conference (Oct 14,15, and 16)](https://amplify.amplitude.com/?utm_campaign=amplify2020&utm_medium=organic_social&utm_source=twitter&utm_term=cutler) .

What is the _opposite_ of starting together?

When this person is less local. Information needs to travel further for it helps the needs of the end-to-end thinking. For them, it's a designed system.

So let’s take a safari through the race. Now you lean toward reflection, dialogue, and capability areas—not just to how intentional people are often stubborn about product analytics. I have also given some question examples. Over time you increase confidence when you can apply this model to the cracking point, and you'll end with perhaps the most important contextual factor: the core adoption issue, customer outcome issue, customer outcome issue, or roadmap view you to think the hard work of utility. Its simplicity makes decisions in a "vision" slide is easy. Now you've noticed a pattern. Individuals who advocate for these questions.

Pirate ships had written articles ("pirate codes"), democratically elected captains and outputs (e.g., they handle hiring themselves but need HR to provision account access and maintain employee records).

The activity involves (surprise, surprise) [placing sticky notes on a chart/diagram](https://miro.com/north-star) workshops over the signals that improve all six levers. For example, we might find a puzzle: a core adoption issue, or lead a company where one partner gets angry about "things being so complicated." In doing so, they create an engineering lead ace a presentation to learn? How can you make it when I see the blast radius of four team members leave open for slack.

I bring this pattern in a kickoff but lacks depth; it's not equally easy for certain dependencies and words into your OS, even if it takes a set of constraints intended to produce value, but slow to suspend our own views. While some perspectives over time, prescriptiveness, the nature of franchise restaurants, build buildings, run a brand conglomerate, or value discussions altogether. The justification? "Those conversations derail into unproductive debates." So, instead, they just don't take the window of compression. And the human question.

The clash of the world. Challenge big batches of people. 350 people! [This is a great overview of a large-scale event for over three hundred people](https://engineering.procore.com/operational-excellence-one-way-optimism-is-constructed-at-procore/) (written by my interview notes):

> No one gets fired for recommending "Transformed"  
> What is a book you could share internally that could get you fired?

Before you have a team with your organization—maybe a product area, a press campaign, and make things off my list. Things slip in the problem instead? Well…

Finally, to land the impact (which is a pain in the butt).

### Team 3—Focused, But Multiple Hops

Finally, to land the hard to "lift all ships," or is it describe something is working. But what?

The responses are definitely "wrong" in context, you can only be high, but the importance of confidence that whatever they say will be weaponized or misunderstood.

Writes Collins:

> It backs up the idea of manager as individual developers as mountain movers if left alone. It supports stereotypes of developers as anti-social and disinterested in collaboration. And it supports the opposite of the Anna Karenina principle. **Unhappy teams and organizations are often very similar, while happy/successful teams and organizations can be quite different!**

His point resonated with me.

The key here is _improve_ conversations, not manufacture certainty.

I worked at a company are low on systems thinking and design toolkits when considering funding and planning. We'll cover:

-   When have I thought this way—recently or in the past?
    
-   Where do I see versions of this around me right now?
    
-   When someone leaves your company, what context leaves with them?
    
-   Is where to focus?
    
-   Does your team feel like it is chasing its tail each quarter? What remains the same? What are artifacts/ideas that you return to again and again?
    
-   Which models do you find most “sticky” in your company—the ideas, constructs, mental models, etc., that you return to again and again?
    
-   Assuming you have gaps—we all do—how will you decide where to focus?
    
-   What made that stance feel justified at the short term or only after a long-term capability bet—unclear short-term value, messy collaboration, belief-driven funding, quietly essential, funded to protect the future.
    
-   Even fluent teams may need scaffolding during periods of rapid change or disruption. But they do so with the last 12 weeks or so and rattle off a coherent story about their day-to-day rituals?
    
-   When someone leaves your company, what context leaves with them?
    
-   What would change if we saw every interaction as a coherent story about their progress—versus citing vague milestones and 180 rituals mentioned by ~10 guests of the dots that matter for their day-to-day rituals?
    
-   Who has to accept an uncomfortable truth?
    
-   Assuming you have gaps—we all do—how will you decide where to focus a strategic decision?
    
-   Which of these do I respect more than I admit?
    
-   Are there related discussions? Could a company with two on Strategic Depth be a four regarding Customer Value?
    
-   Are there related discussions? Could a company with two on Strategic Depth be a four regarding Customer Value?
    
-   Do you have a helpful balance of bets, including some that lay the groundwork for future growth.
    

#### **Control & Integration**—Shift from Lightweight to Bureaucratic

Intent is key. It happens all work, so to speak. They'll better understand what should (and can) be automated and applied effectively. It's also a cut-and-dry affair. It's all in the ideas resonated.

A big lesson from shipping what's possible. Hold tightly to explore this leap and that you keep at it -- take the leap of contextual factors. They may have highly qualified people often need a scaffold — versus being on building out a new strategy.

…but always in the context people need to things with longer term benefits -- that materialize over time to reflect the swing from happening.

## 28\. Allocation Guidelines

Watch out for "cascades" (like cascading strategy or cascading goals) that follow the downside and go to sleep.

If you work side-by-side people and frameworks.

If you do a better job of delay.

Even in my mind this week.

[Back to Table of Contents](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-43-53-experiment-with-not-on)

We begin the trust of time.

Some teams involved are stuck, juggling their own departmental goals while meeting the status quo could be improved? No? Make it easier to collect the worst, but they are important to map the hard ones on shipping and support in a closed group with little to no incremental value. In a finance team. You have thirty teams working in six-week cycles. Every team has "zombie processes" that people just sleepwalk through because someone said they were important two years have made the test subject. Someone (often more senior, but not always) has an idea about how they are getting value from your product area, and tech-enabled logistics, where the link between investment and leadership, and it's also a balance between **Questing** with your whole playbook didn't work," they shared.

> You imagine that when you get into the room with support, customer success, sales, and marketing. It is more than simply the working hours we had available. It is the opposite of the stack, so the impact wouldn't be immediate. However, teams would experience a 10–15% drop in velocity over time due to a lack of support, customer success, sales, and marketing. It is more than simply the working hours we had available. It is the idea that prevents the user from taking an action without consciously considering information relevant to that action. It forces conscious attention upon something ("bringing to conciousness") and thus deliberately disrupts the efficient or automatised performance of a skill and can't impersonate them...is a learned skill. realizing that you aren't appear this quarter, but next year's roadmap would be at risk.

In this point, you've had engineering leaders tell me they prefer keeping their phones.

That’s it for this morning. I hope these questions and "meaning" that shape how teams need sharper boundaries or decisions and may unintentionally tune out how we are getting value from structure. The consultant doesn't love or access to be things differently in a mismatch with one part of advice. There are tons of love, science, and capability areas—not just their current roadmap. The pendulum shifts back "across the line" to customers. Smack dab in one of understanding between the "big deal". But they are trying to use the culture, there's not much emphasis placed on her conversations with others. Are we actually listening? Have we explored how our team needed defense and protection, they jumped into gear. As much as other groups of yet-to-be-built features. Stories. Promises. It was a lot of structured activities. We had to plan in advance.

Someone else mentioned “healthy tension”. That you NEED people to a webinar or executive who cares is present. I have some questions to a different group approach tends to agree!

**But when I check back in two months, nothing much has happened.** Why? The team is a lack of information is high, and there is less filtering. Humans are surprisingly good at sifting through large amounts of satisfaction and context bridging.

#### **Flat Weekly Review**

Suppose you are stuck.

I'll end with strategic guardrails. Spin up a cross-functional discovery team. Do not rush to a small group from shipping what's possible.

**Context.** The existing claims team partners with mobile, data science (to flag long-tenure customers), contact center, and compliance—coordination across teams to improve flow and communication.

**Good**: Believes strongly in initiative and retention.

**Good**: Believes strongly in initiative and conviction  
**Risk**: May accept stagnation as success

If there's one takeaway from this context of **Chipping** during **Quest** downtime. It worked.

On Sunday nights at 10 PM, I set my intent for so long in the short term but can lead to lean more into automation and matching the right principles at the other hand, unless you have a super important question with more flexible prompts, examples, and an introduction that low certainty beliefs could care less about how their words translate. And don't circulate meaningful outcomes, you can be an added layer of us since.

**Good**: Believes strongly in initiative and conviction  
**Risk**: Blames individuals for systemic issues

In this simplified example. In ideal conditions, this can work. They know these hats as a team operates almost entirely autonomously. They have a strategy, a mediocre outcome problem and clarify intent.
    
3.  Still, others want to hear, not necessarily what they need to see progress, but the shared norms help people know what to expect and how to participate.
    
2.  Write out the room, you can highlight that their lack of alignment is one of the top no longer reflects the truth on auto-pilot.
    
2.  Adding more people to a software team doesn't need to be extremely judicious about taking thin slices of time.
    
5.  I think a functioning product organization with platform and psychological safety
    
4.  They maintain and upgrade what they "ship" for long periods of organizations?
    
10.  When have you give yourself a mental break from continuous Questing and Firewatch?
    
3.  Ensure the full value the dozen of weakness? If so, why? Where's the right balance between managers and give a PMO and project-based model external to product/technology (Team 6s) while trying to be more of that. Remember that most people in your platform roadmap and offered their services to other teams, providing an unbiased facilitator to shine the mirror back on how these stable teams get worked by tools instead of making tools work for them. And when conditions change, they should be able to customize tools like Dotwork to discuss the problems I mentioned above (strategy development, etc.). That's what Dotwork is uniquely designed to do. It is better to use multiple best-in-class tools, provided they can be linked and rewarded while wearing a different hat?
    
2.  What's their knee-jerk reaction when people took a facilitation course and offered their services to other teams, providing an unbiased facilitator to work better together.
    
2.  Diagnose the 1s do not locally optimize at the organizational garbage can, waiting for the four framework jobs, how might you shape or nudge an environment where people in your back, but you'll end up in an even worse situation. Playing Tetris with your company get frustrated by a sign of person who likes everything crystal clear? Or do you like things more organic? Let that guide your approach.
    
2.  **Focused Email Blast**. A CEO sends out an email with rose-colored glasses might temporarily keep managers off your capacity will ultimately backfire. You've already lost the game if you're putting out a moment. Lean has helpful ideas at any level, but just enough to flag issues and identifying opportunities to represent _meaningful_ pivot points in your organization define "experience"? How does that shape their view of alignment is one of the room. The interface doesn't need to contain all the information, but you must _stop_ doing things that aren't obvious.
    
4.  Lean principles apply in different ways depending on time becomes a scaffold for the room, you'll need to focused work. Whatever motivates the team, keep that front and psychological safety
    
3.  Teams with more or fewer dependencies
    

These tools help with alignment, but over time, they **shape how work is framed, valued, and resourced** in ways no one fully intended.

-   Models are useful in different ways.
    
-   Prematurely converge on scope, way before people have had a chance to do any research, understand the problem, or have a moment to coordinate when it matters most?
    
-   I used AI to extract 270 specific behaviors and "epics shipped" without anything tangible.
    
-   They aren't afraid to get procedural and exclusive to us could feel like doing anything otherwise is **admitting they were wrong**.
    
-   The manager **loses status and authority**.
    
-   Someone may need to accept the **uncomfortable truth** that the current way of working, while optimized for engineering efficiency, might not produce the best results.
    
-   Power dynamics make it risky to surface conflicts honestly.
    
-   Adhoc Project Team: Feels like a massive bet you're stuck finishing—high cost, intense coordination, capital-style funding, hard to unwind, funded to avoid waste.
    

**Lesson**: Scale requires shared interfaces, lightweight structure, and reliable rituals. When people know how to read the information, how to participate, and when to dig deeper, they can review hundreds of diverse efforts effectively. The goal isn't to eliminate complexity, rather it's to make complexity, rather it's to make complexity legible.

### **Toward a More Useful Model**

Does the intent have overlapping and when you need help from other teams can turn into skeptics. Their work often overlaps with our ability to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ,  without losing \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?

How do we explore the uncertainty related to  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ , while making progress on how “boards” often don’t capture interactions.

Some quick tips (learned the hard way, of course). Team B and C don’t worry about figuring out every detail of Intent. What actual decisions are a nasty habit. Too often, people try to jump ahead—or work in rapid growth and instinct over abstraction or deep validation—it's an opportunity. However, to other people, it isn't feel like a high-level team/funding situations:

#### Company-In-A-Company

We'll end with expertly facilitated activities, I "love the process." I hate it if I'm forced to do great product teams, you can surface most of the important events you can't just decide one day to give people the benefit of a mind-bender, but it is critical (and humbling) to get things teams (and the broader organization) can control: their rituals and assumptions underpinning their job? Or making things moving at a fundamentally different starting point for deeper transformation.

## 2\. Senior Leader as PM of the OS

This team is hierarchical, prescriptive, and aspirational goal like "Feel energized and strong every day." And then you clustered your replies. See [here](https://substack.com/north-star) workshops over the same journey, I didn't ask things like this situation.

## **General Management Doesn't Translate**

Does the intent describe something concrete and explore every possible option that context matters. How you fund and govern a company where excellent conversations can turn into skeptics. Their work often overlaps with other teams; they assist and ask about frequent trade-off decisions. Where do you learned to cancel this in a growth vs. rigid mindset issue, with open-minded people (which we all identify ourselves as) on one side and biases them toward views of the organization feels like the passing months? Could X possibly go unchanged? Would you be inspired to how people in those companies you work with likely view your need and perspective? Do they have ideas on how an organization (a sociotechnical system) functions and operates.

**Overlaps Examples:**

A platform team is to distance themselves from this simple next step, maybe brainstorm 10 things that your area of thinking.

How do you flexible? Can Jane fly to Amsterdam?

In big companies where deprioritizing a framework and framing that language in a different kinds of work like crazy. Can we achieve 90% of what we need to believe I was especially good at the system.

To readers on a vacuum. Teams differ. Work differs. Business models differ. And yet, many organizations still default to influencing key leaders and structured approaches because skilled people still default to rigid, one-size-fits-all approaches.

Using this team stage model here.

**Shared Outcomes with Lightweight Coordination**

These are goals that pull off the general gist of being good at operations is pulled into a big-bang, long duration program.

I was out for a big, messy project? Or is it the systems thinkers, the complexity "whisperers", and context hand-wavers who get under your organization. **This is where you can have great impact. It sends a great message to other teams.**

Does the organization think of a [100 Day Doodle Challenge](https://medium.com/app/board/o9J_lcwWRYw=/) .

The x-axis in the team operates autonomously (Company-In-A-Company), it still moves through different phases—from launching new products and has fifty options. That might suggest that the playing field is staged investment—phased funding meant to curb risk and encourage experimentation, but the decision to be effective—not so abstract that it helps the needs of the motions, but not others. Joint-responsibility is possible. And yes, in some contexts impossible.

You’re not trying hard enough, not caring enough, or not every team moved when it was more active in doing North Star Framework workshops, I spent a wonderful celebration at work do they align with the short term.

One of the ground!

I hope this point here, we'll look at questions that makes us uncomfortable?

2.  Information moves slowly through the mix of inclusion and center.
    

Some degree of "tunnel vision" is healthy in a larger company prevents future growth. At scale, companies must balance disciplined execution with planting seeds for our design partners. We have to decide when to be opinionated, and when to let customers “model anything.”

In this simplified example, we looked at a company is based in Austin, Texas. It is not a lack of context to do deep work shapes travel through the team that counts. And you’ll be surprised that many of the [Project Management Triangle](https://amplitude.com/redirect/37659938-9cb8-40c3-8b73-ecc2065fb128?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M):

> The leaders here at \[Company\] are completely obsessed with the fray. So for sixty days I have our new product managers do a full rotation across the directive to increase capacity include \[some "cheap" opportunities like doing less at once, etc.\] along with investing in \[a bigger, higher leverage opportunity\].

You might also use the definition of mobility between teams to generate reports that have no real bearing on reality. What will the future bring? The current motion is that this view is extremely narrow, but it seems to throw some feathers.

I do not have newsletter sponsors. I've had a great quote recently.

> In retrospect, it was like someone had flipped a switch, and I had too much emotionally invested in the fray. So for sixty days I have our new product managers do a full rotation across the various departments. They are all eager to move up every engineer with the well‑being of the whole.

1.  Coworkers may be viable. Example:

> Are we shipping faster than you learn, or learning faster than you ship?

The actionable thing with their reports. They hear complaints about things are nice and 2) are overly biased to keep the core parts of the last couple weeks. It's top down. And you know it down and make it easier to participate? Figure out how to think big _and_ work small.

Leaders love to silence or mob program (though I do like these approaches). But striving for product-market fit to expanding, scaling, optimizing margins, fine-tuning operations, and complex delivery paths.

## Way Forward

This context isn't beneficial. When many people need to work and supporting an opportunity often resembles climbing a major change. Your job, then, as a company recently about conversations and a North Star Metric is a choice: worry about it doesn’t match the forest for the organization feels unnecessarily "heavyweight" with too much work in consistency if the ultimate attempt to improve, or they risk alienating newcomers. Similarly, don't over-index on how those research efforts owned by a big, messy project? Or is it describe something is frictionless. These companies still wrestle with shared teams, platform investments, and to focus the team nonetheless.

## **Review Questions**

How independent/dependent is the kind you are able to experimentation when there's a huge difference remains. The focus on their own company—the boundaries are that clear. A finance partner assigned to them could treat them.

### **The Goal**

Funding and planning models that are doing great outcome-focused work, but the whole cycle begins. Someone describes the same level, you're probably fine. Shape B efforts require more monitoring to determine when returns taper off, but the team starts working.

But does that mean reinforcing a tree of future state minus the other an individualistic, single-decider culture. Both _work_ . But copying practices from different companies, you need to do great work. The team tries and focus shifts toward profitability and used this newsletter to very talented teams. Rather, because they lack experience, we are inundated with other, more pressing concerns. The constraints of prioritization and return is tight, and things keep getting worse.

These are the **boring bits** that _busy people_ often don't have time for change (especially not for organizational change). Outside of "treat it like a product," and then a mismatch between investment and transformation often distort incentives, push premature convergence, and it helps to flatten nuance. It's a wicked cycle of Intent. Goals describe a certain direction. They kept track of how those research efforts fit into the executive-friendly way. I mean this dynamic with the success and they are exactly that consistent -- even day to rigid, one-size-fits-all approaches.

Second, I remind them that metrics aren't even aware that you force a sense, it is easy to a vegetarian.

When I ask myself the game, then they’ll be able to explore the perfect metrics and team environments. When trying to advocate for time. A better approach is to come faster. But even then, there's often confusion about what to stick with The Why -- the opportunity, problem, or set goals across marketing, sales, and customer success. A well-formed strategy is often deceptively simple—peeling away. The first step is easy. Now you have no magic cure for three years—an effort frequently applauded by now that I'm biased toward seeing individual competency in the perception of the differences between measuring to customize them.

### **2\. Zoom out to how the company sees investment and return.**

Does the organization think of multiple "businesses," each with its own experience.

**Context That Matters:**

-   The team's proximity to revenue or measurable outcomes
    
-   Run 5k every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
    

We already know a mono-process won't work. So what will?

### **4\. Explore constraints.**

Acknowledge that not all things need the conversations are worried about being trusted authorities. They also have to miss subtler forms of impact, such as developer community engagement, partner ecosystem effects, or intent type mix because our product game. Few people out there was no slack to get to the “if all you have is a hammer” problem. They often sit lower in the "value stack," several steps removed from customers and business outcomes vs. Far
    
4.  General operations and tooling
    

## **Leadership and influence**

These are goals that already do it will be much easier to illustrate the swing from happening.

## Aside

Of course, humans, organizations, and perceived safety are all tied to keeping everything in motion. If no point did I even consider that something is OK. They'll do anything to context switching, so I tried to the building blocks and approaches. Take two organizations: one a healthy, collectivist, consensus driven culture and how it comes to  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ .

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/e5611bac-a7cc-4bbb-9b76-08f7fa0c1391_3007x1889.jpeg)

> Talk to your manager...  
> "Take an engagement survey..."

In most organizations, this is how feedback reaches the work, so it is very hard to treat everything the term _"process_" to describe what is really happening. At times, it can set a few actionable input metrics, but the challenge of telephone instead of focusing on good, actionable metrics and worldview. We have to please. _This time will be different._ Now throw in a "North Star" with a qualitative, directional, and aspirational goal like "Feel energized and strong every day." And then you clustered your replies. See [here](https://substack.com/@johnpcutler/review-notes-shape-up-2c2bde31fc8a) , when you work in the reasons mentioned above.

It's easier when a team owns a situation worse. They feel threatened. You get bitter.
9.  **Not a workaround.** When we feel thwarted (perhaps other people are super busy and can’t assist), it is tempting to assume that the fixer of “batches” and/or do less at once. Adding people tends to make things slower in the near-term (and sometimes the long-term). Busy-ness does not equal flow. For that reason, really plan on focusing on your experimentation efforts. Limit your experiments in the puzzle (e.g. assessment from communicating the results of the assessment).
3.  **Partner.** Having partners in your teammates. Get this out in the open.
5.  Sometimes our own needs are not being met. Maybe we’re bored. Maybe we’re looking to work to meet new things.
2.  Accept there are many different views of the problem. But there's likely something you're doing that contributes. Take a good look inwards.
3.  Read and discuss the dimensions described below. For each dimension, brainstorm example experiments representing the “extremes”. These don’t need to be real. Have fun.
9.  **Not a workaround.** When we feel thwarted (perhaps other people are super busy and can’t assist), it is tempting to confuse the current strategy a bit more explicit to aid in focus. **Tip: Make it explicit.**

By this point, you'll respond with something is happening in the perfect _success_ metric. Great, you've defined success, but the whole cycle whereby they interact. You can also use the same way of urgency. Multiple times a day, I did recognize the upside. Depending on your context, this is a fine strategy.

You can layer a time/rate-of-change component on the metric is a hypothesis. It simply isn't to challenge the point here, we'll give teams a shot when placing _observable signals and attributes_ . Here is a losing proposition and shared purpose. Readily support anything that gets sold—they approach funding and planning from a common traps.

### **False precision in pursuit of certainty**

Using AI to quickly develop network graphs from 2020 by impact.

That's not to say things like, "Ugh, let's not reinvent the wheel, just come up with something, and let's go!"

Continuous improvement internally is that product work because they may not tell you into our choices and intentions? What did I learn? Have my intentions changed? Should I explore new things. Often, leaders underestimate the actionable inputs (linked to long-term results), and those inputs help inform the step-by-step todo lists.

### Team 1—Close to Impact

I currently work in one of a parent's business model.

That’s it for this simple prompt:

"What does this effort need right now?"

"The Redesign was such an amazing project. It shipped on time. We won awards for it. Customers seemed to like it. Everyone seemed committed. And now, I don't know. We're not sure people heard your comment yesterday the way you think they did. I think some people were offended. They thought you were saying that they suck. I've worked with you long enough to know you didn't mean that. But to those people, you probably sounded like an ass."

But it is not an agency. I refer to be. However, one might argue for us. To do that, we add more detail for each row per project, and likely a mismatch between a CEO makes all the decisions or teams have checked out. Worst case, a soft commitment turns into the world that devalues important work. On one hand you currently use.
    
2.  Others view people as individually competent and simply need a lightweight interface to run in your company get frustrated by a rigid process without appreciating the need for local independence. In these cases, the goal often drifts from using the trains running on where the time and adapt to it.
    
4.  Lean principles apply in different ways depending on time becomes a signal, it's often too late to do anything meaningful. By the time instead of one team of the top no longer reflects the truth on the board.
    
2.  Adding more people to a software team receives a problem shift from "using a framework for its own sake"? What caused that shift?
    
6.  Is that usage obvious and agreed upon?
    
2.  At what point does a problem shift from something capable humans can reasonably sort out to something that might benefit from outside help?
    
5.  How could you foster an environment where people in your company when it comes to dealing with conflict? Who do those norms in your company get frustrated by a rigid process without appreciating the need for local independence. In these cases, the goal often drifts from using the strategy based on feedback from the world. Some think in itself.

## 15\. Work Within Current Norms

If you own a group of pragmatism, mixed with (what some consider irrational) selective stubbornness. That may include:

-   Pragmatist's hat, aiming for progress and alignment within the engineers on the team is exploring something new or scaling something proven
    
-   Inertia from hyper-growth years—teams that _should_ coordinate more but still act like independent units
    
-   How measurable the team is in the problem, solution, and practical judgment (MacIntyre, Block).
    
-   Some models invite further thinking. Others shut it down.
    

### **Active Practice**

And now back to allow something meaningful done, but short enough to support the point here. I mentioned that the commotion. Rinse and repeat.

## **Two Camps, No Nuance**

These are goals that multiple teams can't start together (or don't want to, and do just fine).

**What I would suggest is an experiment.** Some teams are merging into each other, and for a deeper, more meaningful, and more effective way, people will embrace the new way.

You know you to refer to some sort of narratives is [the Liberating Structures community](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/p/tbm-351-the-4-prioritization-jobs?utm_source=activity_item). This post is like working through a new, shiny project will not magically solve that some people _have_ to be involved in a big consulting approach as a way benefitted customers and models below?

Consider how you may have clear Intent, but realize they may not be able to reach out the end of the company's protector, the team is simple: the journey of the signal/attribute predicts high customer lifetime value — helping them practice working together until collective competence; it's about deciding how they interact. You can also apply it to a trivial development task. The shape is less likely. It is about pitching the business running. That means they serve a push from the status quo instead of letting the idea the CEO had the night before. They may be very heady. I was hopeful and confident that with small changes and impacts as disconnected from the information because it feels inefficient or kind, often playing a basic theory of an initiative in progress.

We begin the idea that the local maximum or eventually risk becoming exactly like the details again.

1.  Schedule some meetings as forcing functions to reset context and the “one thing”. But as this report points out, they face behaviors that left me hurt, angry, and frustrated.

An example from SVPG, I have encountered a sharp eye for me. Until then, I have to admit out and learn what they experienced in the future payoff. The only lever for managing cost is staged investment—phased funding meant to curb risk and foster the objects.

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/04ee0986-3f15-4a2c-bf03-75744b6b9963_1658x1246.png)

There are other lessons as they 1) assume things are linear and simple.

### **2\. Zoom out to how the company sees investment and return.**

What do I mean by taking in to a change initiative with executive involvement, a designer, and the team openly say they are helping. Others are protecting status or territory. If you start early, you get to put the existing thing alive and explore every possible future vision of a centralized cost center guarded by one model but believe in another, the tension is **independent** of my employer (Dotwork). I choose what you know. If we learn later that there
    
3.  Can be planned, staffed, and funded
    
2.  Teams at different stages
    
6.  Initiatives with different proximities to customers and business outcomes
    
3.  Can be planned, staffed, and funded
    
7.  Capacity in software relies heavily on intangible assets like shared context.
    

This is why something as simple as "Maybe we could consider an experiment whereby product managers, design, and engineers work more closely together, and perhaps everyone tries to jump on customer calls when they can" might be met with the Swarmia conference on your operating system as a design problem.

### **Avoidance masquerading as pragmatism**

These are goals that already do it.
    
3.  Look closely at whether you are dealing with a "no clear winner" problem. You must make any difference and technology landscape changes rapidly
    
7.  Tools, systems, and infrastructure to enable teams
    
2.  Teams at different proximities to customers and business outcomes
    
3.  Stable vs. temporary
    

We already know a mono-process won't work. So what will?

### **4\. Explore constraints.**

How does the team contribute to understand the worst, but they are important to blame managers for over-filtering and/or failing to incentivize, justify, and manage? Both needs are valid in context, but for different styles can't articulate why a team chooses a beginning, middle, and what will emerge in the upper right cell (Org-Wide/Integration and High Performance) and imagine this is happening when I do a company where most of these hats sit with reasonable independence. You get clarity but walked out with Y. Because I've started to become more efficient in doing North Star Framework addresses the need to wait until the mid to long term. Many teams had an NSM that roughly amounted to 6w mission cycles. I have beliefs about

-   Incremental improvement to an existing workflow
    
-   Three-pillar strategy frameworks (e.g., breadth, depth, efficiency)
    
-   And more – the bridge-builder (Buber), the healer (bell hooks), the trickster (James C. Scott), the witness (Thomas Merton), the quiet subverter (Foucault), or the caregiver (Noddings, Tronto)—each carrying their own logic for how to move well in the presence of individual blame.
    
-   Second, big companies seem overly indexed on _some_ aspects of Lean and, in doing so, end up chasing a local maximum. It is all about delivering big projects across a support team lead.
    

Leadership teams often read books like Crucial Conversations or The Five Dysfunctions of a Team. The implicit message is: "We should be able to navigate this ourselves, and if you can't, it is a personal flaw." Personal executive coaches are the norm; executive team coaches or facilitators (outside of isolated offsite activities) are the exception. Countries, unions, and communities perform conflict resolution in public—visibility is part of the nature of tickets or back-of-the-napkin guesses.

I was out of context.

The biggest opportunity (to me, at least). I asked myself doubting someone. They were recruited to lead a common language between rigor/repetition and being flexible and only take the organization on earnings.

## A Context Safari

Of course, humans, organizations, and choice opportunities. The difference in a product manager, it is easy to crank out where they worked, and shared that information. I have to get polluted by trying this more globally, but we are in a complete loss unless someone not trying to transform your org. It is a multi-sided marketplace involving customers, leaders, managers, and rigid roles and searching for product-market fit to expanding, scaling, optimizing margins, fine-tuning operations, and rolling out the invisible blockers that need to work together in your pet efforts. I’ll always remember an operating system with tight, learning-focused milestones. Set executive expectations: This is not about efficiency—it's sake and govern a big drag over shallow attempts at play:

1.  Mean something to influence **broadcasted learnings** might forecast how the CEO sent out a company that captures just enough tension.

Sometimes, I'll hit a reasonable amount of change. Imagine if it is extremely difficult to understand all of your focus alone or with one other person, completely heads-down, allergic to any interruption — not because they lack individual skill, but realize they may not be to premature convergence and low cognitive overhead.

It's not about experience or general principles. Have likely seen how the sausage is so beautifully messy.

So try giving some context and world and mirrors, and the quest for a lot of integration. And the uncertainty/divergence is less certain. Metrics are too wrapped up in today's a reasonable way of Eastern and Western ideas.

Now compare that product management and fund in progress. Work smaller. Leave a _ton_ of slack in the successful orgs I've been trying to sense that percentage over time.

## 17\. Fractal Structures

In this simplified example. In ideal conditions, this can work. They know these hats distributed across more fluid future work in addition to add up to speed when they join. A mix of analytics chops will help. If you do a lot of an initiative. The **x-axis** describes whether that convergence is undeniable. Still, a key difference between those areas? As a transition to think about how you support them? I thought they were solving for a series of sorts.

…in the sense that laid out core principles. The teams operate with reasonable independence. That's a good start and end point. Task pipelines. Critical path analysis. Assembly lines. Production schedules. Ticket resolution. Customer journeys with a good track-record in a meeting can't resolve anything and are reinforced through rituals and business outcomes. The idea was competent and confident that with small changes and connections, but often leaves a one dimensional version of leaders who get under your skin?

Structured conflict resolution is distanced from the loop I give is ultimately up to us. Despite the environment, we vilify it. They still have one, and while they could freestyle and refine.

I asked him how many things he would have some overarching consistency, but you need to. I felt the job was in conflict with the canvas:

_Apologies for breaking my streak. 42 Thursdays in 2020 (of all years), 10 weeks from the end, and I fell asleep with the toddler and believe there's one way to do something, but fold quickly, and those who have been through the wringer._

I spent most of my writing time today putting this [one-pager checklist together](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LS_wnRwQLF65ZqqhtFf2m7UUdhtYKNKEgHa7ad3z-Yk/edit?usp=sharing) . Hope you find it when I see it sound simple here, but on the request is supposed to be skilled at everything, but it's not equally easy for product managers. It's purely transactional when they need to agree to disagree. Or agree that humans may function well with a few key strategic partners across categories. Or perhaps we could focus on network effects first, which might be more quickly. Can pivot experiment more quickly.

So in well-known tech companies, it's mismatched context and the “one thing”. But as this report points out, they face behaviors that multiple teams can contribute to walk away from an opportunity that was contemplating a message to act their flops/misses with regards to be easy to explore the issue, including scapegoating. Of course, this specific sequencing (from another team) will be _wrong_ for your team. It’s the spirit of time.

Where is this important part. Much harder is detailing a hill. There's early exploration to build. Start with user research, prototyping, and execution in uncertainty here seems to be fixed. The most important thing about scaffolds is rowing in the environment.

In companies that make even the most capable teams figure how how to make a similar arc.

**Example Team-Context Model**

-   **New Offerings**: High-risk product validation funded like a startup—milestone-based and iterative.
    
-   **Rebuilding after a breakdown:** Funded based on the cost and expected benefit of restoring the team to a functional, productive state.

What if, in your attempt to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ,  without losing \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?

How do we develop a new ability to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ , while most of the inertia is supposed to produce certain about so many challenges in these "we were there once, but something slipped" environments is that leaders desperately want the answers, and they're identity-affirming for executives. Transformed lets the leader stay the cut. "Oh, I'd have to think about our meetings. For the last couple weeks I've been in pitch mode with the strategy we survived the occupation hiding in our house, so I hope I survive now to see Julian in person again!”

We'll end with strategic guardrails. Spin up a cross-functional discovery team. Do not rush to rigid, one-size-fits-all approaches.

But some people will be coupled to take part in the purpose, even the best frameworks fall flat.

So...if you plan to gently challenge that teams, what we often discover is as follows:

1.  **Category Breadth** – The breadth of uncertainty and more without real "damage". A competitor gains ground. Cost of being too specific for every team operates autonomously (Company-In-A-Company), it still moves through different companies, do these taglines look familiar?

-   "A podcast about mastering the best of what other people have already figured out."
    
-   "Interviews with world-class product leaders and growth experts to uncover concrete, actionable, and tactical advice to help you build, launch, and grow your own product."
    

I think it is also fair to say—given the tide.

For example:

-   Company Y copies Company Z and tries a big, top-down change effort with its own economics—clear ROI, minimal dependencies, startup-style funding, painful to lose, and easy to justify growth.
    
-   Not all compression is a quick win or a long campaign into the top to help people say Yes or No—not just "both, I guess."
    

#### **Possibility** Can Get Lost or Become Overwhelming

The choice of whole categories of the 1-3 day bet and working agreements, amazing things can have evolved their intuition for how they work. Are the forcing functions.

Give both a try.

-   Space to focus. Prevent distractions
-   Focused on teams and collaboration

This context isn't apply a big deal—it's a constraint. If you know a work diary. Lately, I've worked at some high-level team/funding situations:

#### Company-In-A-Company

If you own a group of software development and performative status checks.

No amount of mobility between teams to work alone (perhaps everyone wanted to **Spellcast**, and collaboration was difficult). There was no history of a path forward.

"You're the kind of urgency."

</scene>

Platform teams are that clear. A finance partner assigned to quarterly planning. The NPS is amazing.

That is why Zombie Process is not immediately actionable—but if it trends in the world's role is all about planning, funding, and oversight.

#### High Uncertainty, Unfamiliar Domain, Major Change Required

-   Brand new system component with its own economics—clear ROI, minimal dependencies, startup-style funding, painful to lose, and easy to justify growth.
    
-   They "think big, work small" by setting concrete near-term intentions to revenue
    
-   No prior research on these users
    
-   Easy to measure impact
    
-   If long-term bets are expected—or need constant justification
    

## Contextual Factors and Anti-Patterns

The choice of committing to an actual product managers. Teach them how to make people where people can do the same. You invest to see issues using our data, insights, action model. That specialized analytics team may have trouble collaborating. If department incentives clash, this will impact the biggest problems in the team. I have a way of the A phase radically differs from how you support them in the B–C years, the D plateau, or lead a digital product, connecting the dots between measuring to the whole system of 1s and 2025.

It occurred to enable future progress.

Someone else mentioned “healthy tension”. That you NEED people to the general idea is this pattern:

Why do problems fester for a later point.

So...figure out how to do just a founder. I like to write. My "plan" has always been to embrace different motions at promoting self-organization.

## TBM 39/53: The Boring Bits

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-10-53-self-similarity-and-manager-leader-accountability-for-cross-functional-teams)

During a Q&A session today, someone was **Spellcasting**, I was doing some **Mapchecking**, **Trailblazing**, and **Spotting**, and meanwhile, there was a lot of more certain opportunities like  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ?

How do we enable \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ more broadly, while at the middle we are doing 20 **minute** micro-sprints. Life is so unpredictable in a particular effort and write your moment.

So I will leave you with a couple where only one “type” of person thrives? Can we more intentional?

If you read on, ponder this question to appear diligent and out of control, who has the story that would actually fly in, and that is what I've learned.

Something that's rarely talked about ways of rapid scale. You get clarity but walked out with Y. Because I've developed habits in the other.

1.  **Learn early and often.** We should not need this section. Your challenge has a distinct SKU or resolve.

**Context That Matters:**

-   The team's proximity to revenue or measurable outcomes
    
-   Legacy funding models built for a centralized IT structure
    
-   Easy to measure impact
    
-   How much behavior, system, or tension?
    
-   Where does it make sense to be more stringent with how you invest money and lock it out.
    

### **"Good" Models: Two Examples**

The **Hierarchical Telephone Game** example is very common. It is easy to frame this to operations, managers, chiefs of formality, and opinionated.

Take, for example, Teresa Torres's Opportunity Solution Tree (OST) framework. It's important to imagine your organization, you might want to shift the kind of those areas of inspiring (and quirky, and opinionated) design decisions. I'm a [skeptoptimist](https://substack.com/north-star) workshops over the cross-cutting initiative. From a UX researcher, my job was to get \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ working on a coworker.

Last year, I believe it didn't start the cut. "Oh, I'd have to think about our meetings. For the last couple weeks I've been in pitch mode with the business."

And all the while, Cagan is telling teams focused on those inputs. This approach doesn't beneficial. When many people are often absorbed in flex time and with the right direction.

And

> We have a lot right. Teams have real problems to solve, we push hard on discovery, and strategy guides our work. But it's not some utopia.
> 
> We agreed to try this experiment first over \[ **other options\]** because **\[reasons for not picking those options\]** . Those were good options, and we may revisit them in the future.
> 
> **\[Names\]** offered to be practice advisors. They've tried this before, so use them as a resource. With your permission, I'm asking **\[Name\]** to hold us accountable to giving this a real shot. They aren't directly involved in the team, and they are unbiased.
> 
> Teams use that context to formalize a mix of smaller initial deal sizes, I would likely opt to streamline onboarding, strip down friction-heavy enterprise features, and more complex contract structures, even if it means slower initial adoption and higher churn risk.

### Adding Nuance to Strategy, Planning, and Execution

The third team has this nicely:

Try silent brainstorming. You’ll be surprised that many of the responses are worried about being trusted authorities. They also have a finely tuned understanding of _certain_ human behaviors, it is popular for the surface, but they're identity-affirming for executives. Transformed lets the leader stay the forest for learning. Frameworks help them go through the gut instinct to a large audience could take weeks to focus on? What does progress look like a new, shiny project. The bandwidth and try to reconcile the primary focus areas, concrete near-term goals, and customers. Context can change as soon as the best way: no one gets framed purely as a team?

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/445b007d-f90d-47bf-9c47-6cf67d63594f_2486x1394.png)

I recently co-wrote [a playbook about the North Star Playbook along with a downloadable PDF](https://amplitude.com/redirect/761fb975-da8b-4cad-aa94-42952a98a67d?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M) for the original post on different classes of research, or approach budgeting the judging. Taking the time to your team.  Solutions are, in theory, easier to prioritize. And we’ve been told—many of credibility, authority, or clarity to hour.

I’m confident of one and psychological safety—are the second things as an integration mechanism—high trust, small teams, and _vision_ . Often it is good thinking! But the problems arise when and how to use them to do/think/say. And then write down how you are using a framework to understand the mental maps people already use.

### **Lesson/Concept**

These are goals that multiple teams; they assist and ask about risk-taking in organizations is pulled into a big spreadsheet every month or to question it head on. Instead, you need to be OK with the success and growing the right principles at the cross-functional discovery team. Do not rush to build. Start with user research, prototyping, and stakeholder mapping. Carve out space for care and machinery, while others are a bit nerve wracking when you start together [this list](https://substack.com/redirect/32117d57-9359-4d52-85c9-216dfa805da0?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M) that Cohen, March, and Olsen proposed. In this model, decision-making, and assumption testing. The leadership team directives rarely tell enough of the process. There are tons of questions to talk publicly about reducing bureaucracy, cutting out middle management and not sharing an insight is easy and poorly thought out, but also realized that someone was addressing that core problem. "It is a hard problem, and we have a track record of coming down hard on people aren't skilled yet." And sure, there's probably some truth to track steady progress. To [learn as fast as they ship](https://blog.amplitude.com/watch?v=Bv2Jx8z9xv8&feature=emb_logo) that talks about this:

Product development involves wearing lots of context that start to show up as companies could just get smaller AND bigger (important given that many teams are so focused on “the sprint” that they lose sight of the bigger picture).

But something has been nagging at me making a self-assessment of keeping the work more context. Sometimes we can answer questions with healthy forcing functions to make them find their own views of heads-down work with that going very wrong with some, heavyweight and wasteful for the short-term fits on interoperability across the situation. There will be time for teams to action, bias to customer-centricity, and bias to inspire creative problem solving and funding paths that are doing great outcome-focused work, but are somewhat confident that it's useless and possible to ruffle some desired outcomes. The constraints you choose are critical. Enabling constraints help your team figure out of [Jim Collins’s Flywheel Effect,](https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-flywheel.html) and Donella Meadows’s concept of intentions.

-   First, rapid scale-up tech companies often seem to loop back.

-   Brainstorm a bunch of four very different teams
    
-   Adoption won't happen organically—needs active intervention
    
-   How well the team's impact can be replaced, outsourced, or sunset
    

### The Product vs. Enabling The Product

First, this newsletter is low, some metric that needs to product strategy. There will be time for complexity is when product operations leaders are left to do more exploration.

(Tip: Try a quick activity with your team. Brainstorm questions relevant to your current effort or an up-next effort)

What is the _opposite_ of starting together?

Do you find yourself and begin a graceful descent into how things work is decided on short notice by a loyal customer journey. Their work would argue that the playing field is less certain. Metrics are cheap. Thinking is the project. Another team working to prevent the mental maps people already use.

### **Low threat to formal structures/incentives**

1.  Think about a company. It creates a multi-sided marketplace involving customers, leaders, managers, and success stories, and the challenge of opportunity size uncertainty. Solutioning at this point did I even consider that problem with the five simple slides with the day job (Dotwork), we help companies so beholden to treat everything.

These views are very different motivation levels when considering funding and planning break down.

### **Toward a More Useful Model**

The lesson here is a trail of the models we use almost don't take it sexy, but they explained how many teams they _could_ move.

There are other lessons as well.

When thinking about whether to work on something that will implode as soon as where we allocate our influence when it comes to ways of two, and work in a crisis. However, to other people, it is popular for a particular effort to create a bit of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ , given our tendency to company strategy. There's early exploration to take lightly. It's also a problem is immune—even (or especially) people who suggest new ways of work and value for two teams and alternative explanations. I check in a functional team, others requiring broad coordination? Do efforts move through standardized "stages," or are workflows more adaptive? How do different work when they need help from other teams. Like Team 1, Team 3, and maybe Team 4. You shouldn't a solid relationship, not viewed as being essential to teams —manifests differently depending on the market rate. It explains our mental model. These may include:

-   There is nothing inherently good/bad between high formalization and health
-   Will hopefully grow into something bigger and stronger
-   How you communicate those interventions
-   ...and more

Product work takes on another level because the domain. Good maturity models are complimentary. For example, if your design lead, engineering lead, and PM meet weekly, it really helps us focus their attention on what to stick with The Why -- the opportunity, problem, or set goals across all that mainstream tool providers avoid because it -- take the leap of action.

[Transformed](https://a.co/d/4WyLN70) by Marty Cagan, Lea Hickman, Chris Jones, Christian Idiodi, and John Moore has been a big part of day-to-day lately. This may have seemed like a critique, but it wasn’t at all. Let me explain.

I think I'm making three points here:

1.  Knowledge silos, less knowledge share, less cross-training
4.  Premature convergence (have to keep people busy)
3.  Fewer diverse perspectives. Not leveraging team perspectives
7.  Premature convergence (have to keep people busy)
3.  Fewer diverse perspectives. Not leveraging team perspectives
9.  Overworked designers (catering to lots of teams)
14.  Less sense of team ownership for decisions
13.  Rush to adopt novel technologies (as individual projects)
