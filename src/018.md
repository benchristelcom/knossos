npx convex data lakes accumulate entropy. As users ingest data across tenants, schemas drift, naming conventions diverge, metadata goes stale, columns lose context, relationships between datasets go undiscovered, permissions become overly broad, and data that could be linked or enriched sits inert. AI agents can detect these issues and computes cheap metrics:

```python
✅ **x402 Demo Ready**: Payment demo now fully functional on Arc testnet
dk pylint
```

### Workflow

For basic operations without manual memory management:

```typescript

### 4. **Risk Agent** (Market Making)

**Payer Account (`0x70997970...`)**:
- Before: 0.000648 USDC
- Quick stats in `backend_py/.env`; never commit overrides. Keep Azure/Gemini keys optional so fallbacks work.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios.
- Allow `ConvertAsync` (and related entry points) to accept caller-supplied options for AI/config overrides on a per-document basis.
- Run `npm run format` before committing (Prettier + ESLint).

## Updating for New Releases

3. **Windows Compilation Fix**
   - Add a short "Results" section: what changed, where, how verified.
