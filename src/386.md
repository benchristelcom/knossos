# BERDL Data Lake Stewardship System — Multi-agent design with human-in-the-loop curation

_Multi-agent data stewardship with human-in-the-loop curation for a governed multi-tenant scientific data lake._

## Problem Statement

[](https://gist.github.com/dauglyon/d81a96b812b3298f8d862005387b9a0c#catalog-analyst-two-phase-startup)

**State Channels**:
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8000/health
{"status": "healthy", "timestamp": "..."}
```

Also check:
```
https://arc-ai-agents-[random].streamlit.app
deno compile --allow-read --allow-net music-tagger.ts
```

#### When to Use Worktrees

1. **Network Badge**: Display current network in UI-friendly strings; reuse instead of rolling custom formatters.

JobGenerator determines job slots, applies idle tool modifiers each tick, and fires OnJobGenerated when new work appears—hook here for development and Airbyte.

**Example: Agent with Weather Tool**

```php
curl http://localhost:8000/docs

The app consumes data from the externalEntities array when loading.
