# 🚀 Code Guidelines

## Testing Workflows Locally

### Folders

### Test Isolation Strategy (@DirtiesContext)
- **Quality Analysis**: See `ai-docs/coding-standards.md` for LLVM-style guidelines and best practices
- **Code Signing**: Configured for macOS security compatibility
- **Final state**: Expert agent using verified skills (vs. direct tool calls or fallback)
- **Three buttons**: Back (left), Cancel (center), Submit (right)

#### On-Demand Data Gathering
export const addTask = mutation({
  args: {
    id: v.string(),
    embedding: v.array(v.float64()),  // Vector field
    await handleDuplicateGroup(duplicate.files);
  }
}
```

### Best Practices for Streaming Processing

When adding a new isolated environment (e.g., `~/gt/`). Contains all projects, agents, and configuration.

### Complete Configuration Structure

```bash
# Get active space expeditions with astronaut assignments
│   └── models.py            # Command handlers (index, search, query, chat, serve)
○ This namespace follows this standard structure:
- `context`: The loaded context payload
- `Credentials`: User/agent identity with JSON persistence
- `FileOperationError` - File read/write errors
- `go.mod` -> Go | `Cargo.toml` -> Rust
- `ci/docker/qemu_esp32_docker.py:184-275`

## Test Results

### 4. Monitor Gas Costs
- Data Classes: AgentContext, AgentResult

### Local vs Production Environments

**NEVER**:
- What card combinations have the highest win rates?
- Do I need architecture context or share‑image outputs for routing config
- Prefer technical clarity over promotional content
- Log streams are holding file locks

### Which Agent Needs Private Key?

**Answer: Settlement Agent**
