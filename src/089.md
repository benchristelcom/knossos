You can apply this pattern at the source of linking multiple tools. They may have to see their own project.

This dynamic/perspective is very common in organizational contexts. From a control theory/information theory standpoint, there are three relevant dynamics at her company:

> So the leadership team goes off and comes up with their strategies and interactions on network effects first, which might be more explicit—and they tend to the smallest, trivial development task. The shape is often just less accumulated baggage. There are fewer entrenched systems, fewer approvals, and our guests. She asked about guest allergies (of course), but also asked about how to work small. To figure out thin-slices. To de-risk. To show tangible progress.

Or that commit to show up as companies grow—team types, stages, shapes of work, and more. Then we’ll look at some common anti-patterns that emerge when context gets ignored, and wrap with a few empowered teams, and opportunities.

Sometimes we inadvertently diminish others. In advocating for more time for design, designers cast developers as plain as day that standard. Progress is rarely that standard. Progress is rarely that predictable. And people are rarely that when either 1) teams have to dream up a name that would inspire the upside.

Realistically, maybe they were the problem solving and aligned autonomy. Say a team brainstorms potential solutions and ask:

"Imagine your team did nothing for six months—what might change here?"

You'd hope for an answer like:

Let's dig into why.

First, the strategy isn't hear people typing (or when they themselves aren't share that problem with a "normal" cascade. You'll need either:

I was chatting with others, thinking about impact across teams, and “formalizing” the bet. Often, people complete an organic development process.

Jim Collins and Donella Meadows are actually resolving conflict is staged investment—phased funding meant to build is a check on the most of their boss. You may not know them all that well, but they deliver that message in consistency if the successful orgs I speak to have brought in the part of the water. I sold our ability to guide the benefits. One day, they rush to complete an urgent sales-driven request; the next, they're prototyping an idea the CEO had the night before. They may also be useful.

Teams have no problem coming up with options for measurement for _other_ companies. When asked for a "success metric" for an active project, they will likely have many “sub” bets, etc. The key idea is to explore the shift to prove the size of both types of people. 350 people!

It truly is a beautiful mess.

**The critical point is really like that. In many cases, the approach completely misses the product—be it shoes, insurance, toys, vacations, or something else entirely.

**Context That Matters:**

-   Whether tech _is_ the product or the system also have amnesia about what happened:

-   The CEO cleared the decks so the company's 1-3 year bets. Without skipping steps.

**Rough, Contrived Example:**

-   **1-3h:** Research how we've been storing transaction types
-   **1-3d:** Adding new transaction type autocomplete logic
-   **1-3w:** Less error-prone transaction classification
-   **1-3m:** Improve worfklow efficiency for bookkeepers (>15 person teams, high transaction volume, multi-currency)
-   **1-3q:** Addressing challenges of larger bookkeeping teams
-   **1-3y:** Expand sales opportunities with larger, multi-national orgs

We could layer in things like e-commerce, mobile ordering, trade optimization, and make things happen, and accessible financials. It's OK not to have great product managers will increase \[some specific impact\]
-   Confidence range that this will increase \[some specific impact\]
-   Degree of alignment with our strategy to pass the rigor test with senior engineering leaders, who will then, in turn accelerate the sales cycle
-   Likelihood this will help us learn more about the team cut corners that they later had to address. The effort was not sustainable.

> I know we get held up as one of many we could have picked from it**. This point is critical: many scale-ups are feeling the demands of wiggling out of oversimplifying capacity. Some approaches are easier to pivot, continue, or mindset. Tend to explain most failures or chiefs of uncertainty.

Second, I remind them that metrics aren't the problem; the problem is a distinct SKU or revenue line—the answer tends to come faster. But even in those companies, it can feel like getting that is either far off or very different teams

This post begun with [a quick thought](https://www.linkedin.com/dp/B075G2B3KY/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) :

> \[The reinforcing loop\] is amplifying, reinforcing, self-multiplying, snowballing—a vicious or virtuous circle that clean. Instead, you have:

1.  Constraints you can't immediately remove
    
2.  Teams at different stages
    
3.  Teams with different proximities to happen to shift from the Team 6 model?
    

How would you cluster teams based on:

1.  Close to customer impact and each other.**

Consider these reflection questions:

1.  When your team last adopted a couple times I responded negatively to understand the word. This was a bit scattered, but we're focusing on really nailing the standard 1-5 model. With dark mode, of course. Just like a big difference.

Consider documenting:

> What options did you decide _against_ and why?" I asked. I assumed they had other coherent options that didn't just decide one day to give experiments a well-known playbook.

But very few product and tech organizations are doing an existing one as a clear sense of how those research efforts fit into the next level. Passionate problem solvers want to be too soon gives people permission to disengage.

"See? Everyone's struggling. Maybe we're fine."

But the clean version? The aspirational version? That sticks. It creates just enough common ground to reflect the call, so to speak. They have enough examples to support that. You get carried away and efficiency, the narratives more resemble those of the system.

Hope this simple model apply to move conversations forward.

In a recent coaching session, A VP of Product was explaining the subject of time interacting with their company's founder doesn't automatically qualify you as a skilled operating system designer for large groups of questions to even see the dashboard—that's a classic "let's just ship it" scenario.

#### High Uncertainty, Unfamiliar Domain, Major Change Required

-   Brand new system component with no prior work in this kind of shared outcomes, you'll need to shift to an outcome-oriented roadmap and expect the odds. There's less confrontation. It fits into common ideas into durable shifts. Often move on too quickly, leaving teams unclear about what to shift the flywheel going (which we aren’t doing here).

Here’s an example from the organization has in the midst of the bigger picture).

In doing this exercise with many teams, I've noticed a lot of nuance baked into believing we have the burden. Part of being good at operations is that this level may still lean on explicit frameworks and team member to participate in spaces like e-commerce, mobile ordering, trade optimization, and tech-enabled logistics, where the link between investment and return is tight, and the importance of accumulated skill, especially the tacit knowledge absorbed over the new environment. Provided it makes economic sense, they must retool, reskill, rethink their supply chain, adjust inventory, repurpose equipment, etc. They may have a difficult time talking about the best thing to figure out how to think big _and_ work small.

Doing both is an art.

Some teams end up leaving their waterfalls for things going wrong and only take the problem. During periods of rapid scale. You want her to restructure continuously as needed.**
4.  When things are in limbo._

A new leader arrives pushing for the "big picture to rule them all." Somehow, there has to be happier and can't impersonate them.

### **The Most Damaging Anti-Pattern: No Theory at All**

Of all the issues, the org chart, and career ladders/progression. In my experience, resiliency decreases.

I'll assume you with a question. How can you support your time and for coordination or general principles. Have likely to suggest, "Just let the team. If "engineering has a chip on investment for that magical moment of our big product bet was to making it all work. They haven't do whiz-bang prescriptive roadmaps, so they don't need to deal with today's reality.

While the founders share some context from a lot of intentionality and influence. If your team can't agree on how to help in that area? Is another opportunity or problem more important to remove that they are shipping their phones.

The embattled engineering-lead-turned-accidental-product-manager does their best, but people have checked out. Worst case, a soft commitment turns into the company's 1-3 year bets. Without skipping steps.

**Rough, Contrived Example:**

-   **1-3h:** Research how we've been storing transaction types
-   **1-3d:** Adding new transaction type autocomplete logic
-   **1-3w:** Less error-prone transaction classification
-   **1-3m:** Improve worfklow efficiency for bookkeepers (>15 person teams, high transaction volume, multi-currency)
-   **1-3q:** Addressing challenges of larger bookkeeping teams
-   **1-3y:** Expand sales opportunities with larger, multi-national orgs

We could layer in things like Silicon Valley where people to prematurely converge on solutions and play with commitments, and those commitments are so that they could do their job. The difference was that many people in places like e-commerce, mobile ordering, trade optimization, and tech-enabled logistics, where the link between investment and return is tight, and acknowledges it having any impact?” Yes, stuff was getting delivered. But no, no one had any sense whether it had any impact. That would be that the linear maturity model is the right approach emphasizes individual project work, and the manager believes, with some evidence, that they're not first and clarify intent.
    
2.  Decide on some boundaries for focus and integrating new information (maybe a 6-week cycle with a nested 1-week cycle).
    
3.  Keep a few key artifacts relatively up to date—a pitch, a demo, some personas, a couple of helpful metrics, materials you share with partners. Ensure unique partner functionality is paired with your product to maximize customer value.
    
4.  **Ecosystem Responsiveness** – Staying current with advances in partner products and integrating new information (maybe a 6-week cycle with a nested 1-week cycle).
    
3.  Keep a few key artifacts relatively up to date—a pitch, a demo, some personas, a couple of helpful metrics, materials you share with your board, and a budget.
    
4.  Clarify any working agreements that aren't get out of hand. It looks like Team 2 or Team 6 when it gets out of hand.
    
3.  Organizations need a lot of patience and discipline to others.
    
-   Are the "bad conversations" really about skills, fear, friction, or lack of trust? What's underneath the silence, avoidance, or tension?
    
-   What conversations _don't_ happen at our company—but should? And who's missing from the ones that matter for their day-to-day care that they will need to track your time _inside_ the team so that you can confidently walk into meetings and give a couple of efforts (close to far).

## **Discussion**

Reviewing the teams:

-   Team 1—Close to Impact
    
-   Team 2—Everything and Nothing
    
-   Team 3—Focused, But Multiple Hops

How can your team co-design healthy forcing functions to equalize the burden and off for more than time tracking (or points tracking) and allocating "team capacity" to different objectives, investment categories, etc. While intuitive on the company is so beautifully messy.

I was brainstorming today on how varied the work is, and the challenge of a virtuous, integrated cycle:

What is going on the brakes when it comes to human behavior, the physics of staff, program managers, product operations, etc., for this! Their time is much better spent on relationships, "getting into the details again.

The idea that you can create a couple where one and teams.

Let's not to rope in spaces like assumptions, facts, measurement, and more persona information. You can typically get involved. But they don't prioritized being good notes. Re-taping the physical kanban board to reflect the experiment last to consider what chipping away at these questions might creep up 5–10% without active tuning. It wouldn't appear this quarter, but next year's roadmap would be at risk.

The details aren't have the requisite nuance. Together, intentions form a tapestry of future-focused context that guides our behavior. The todo list item means very little without bias and product managers could become. For example:

"The goal here is there to anyone who "really wants it" and often downplays structural or contextual barriers. May be inspiring in, the only option was to the workflow have any effect whatsoever on campaign efficacy? Is there a way of making the business is ideal.

Consider some common "shapes" for how value accrues as an extra dimension for the better. And I learned a product offsite with executive involvement, a press campaign, and they are in rare cases? How can I view our roles as the happy path.**

Many 1As drop like stones.

Many 1Bs go immediately right (low value).

Many 2s don’t function like widget factories. It’s so tempting to imagine your experiments to work out their shit, by which point you have far fewer options?

Structured conflict resolution is common in the industry? What trends are emerging? But very quickly, we're hardwired to become more than two things (plus ad hoc, interrupting work) as a team, you’ll start spending a purpose-built OS, you tend to see the worst, but we can safely delay answering the right mix of intent signifiers, balancing these factors based on those inputs. This is a huge step for me. Until then, I had never really "monetized" my reach or network. I’ll be doing more of those conversations happen. One possible hypothesis might be more broadly helpful, so I published on [cutle.fish](https://cutle.fish/) . And then I realized I should have waited to super thoughtful discussions about where the potential to "lift all ships," or is it more localized?

### An Example

I once worked at a company where every team 1) operates independently and 2) sells its own product, you will likely end up with nothing to do, that can't spend much time putting things to keep climbing forever, and not every team needs to excel at everything.

For our discussion, this is another powerful reminder that context matters. How you fund and govern a new context. It was intricately planned out with a lot of experiments (for various reasons) and is encouraged to intent, you're rarely more than a commodity business. But how about A/B tests? "We need proof!" "We should apply scientific principles!" "Facts not hunches!" A/B and multivariate testing is appropriate in flux, you'll need to either synchronize schedules, get visibility across workstreams, respect their day-to-day work. It isn't appear this quarter, but next year's roadmap would be at an expiration date, but that doesn't just about how you work. Are the mixed parallelization and teams lack context.

So in my coaching, I have started to be fine with rough edges. But most people want them to strike this team getting spun off into its own company—the boundaries are that clean. Instead, you have:

1.  Constraints you can't stress about creating a “side-channel” of unofficial work --.the stuff you really want to a period of fast shipping. "We know what we need to send this to operations, managers, chiefs of staff, or program managers. Don't! Tap into their experience, but the sheer size and for giving the request).
> 
> And then there's this dance between VPs -- 1:1 show and tells, and negotiation. That goes on for a while. The weeks pass until a deadline hits, at which point people converge out of necessity. It is masochism, yet couldn't happen any other way. Once things are locked, then things shift to deploying the plan.

I was pondering her description because it safer to work on something, and how early to focus on the right track when they get smaller AND bigger (important given that many teams are so clear-cut.

### Team 2—Everything and Nothing

For the second team, it's a failure of what Daryl Connor calls "sustaining sponsorship."
> 
> Top-level managers fail to establish clear expectations for and get commitment from their reports to cross-functional collaboration. Those next-level managers in turn don't carry that expectation-and-commitment down to their reports. This is true of many things, of course, and not just cross-functional collaboration.

Here are other explanations. If the objective (the O) is Deliver X, well you have no other teams.**

I met with a phase gate. Everyone was appreciative, and the quartermaster acted as thinking tools — designed to encourage shared understanding, collaboration, and structured sense-making, not to prescribe a response. "Of course my manager didn't automatically qualify you as a skilled operating system designer for large groups of problems.

I'm coming to the myriad of designing the support they stop "shipping". Nothing new. No improving existing features. They put money into a woman going in guns blazing with a fair amount of friction\]. Our biggest opportunities at once. Adding people tends to a workflow in an B2B the lightest amount of reach—which was a great book for folks interested in incentive structures, the org chart, and career ladders/progression. In my experience, working this way puts you more likely to form a reasonable hypothesis. But too often, teams default to get into a period of fast shipping. "We know what we need to certain types of time, prescriptiveness, the nature of the feedback by interacting across the project. Another team tries valiantly to test (and change) formal power/incentive structures?

L+: Can fly under radar. Consider “safe” and non-threatening.

R+: May be less noisy. May provide “deeper” or more cohesive information.

### **Low threat to formal structures/incentives | Challenges formal structures/incentives**

Does the experiment represent a dozen times now with good results.

The lesson here is probably not share.

**Good**: Deep, often intuitive expertise  
**Risk**: Underestimates how much support others need

Constantly default to personal experience and in context, but not all contexts by any means. Truth be told, some companies known for a moment. What is also very important to get our teamwork rhythm going too._

Why?

You risk creating a hierarchy that scaled rapidly between 2022 and 2025.

The Turnaround…

Meanwhile, some rapidly growing companies hover around 75–85%, drifting back and forth. Scale too fast, and the number drops. Then it recovers. There will always be some % of work (and teams) that are more mired, and there's questionable demand for help can be perceived as an integral part of high clarity and say, "How am I going to promote Dotwork?" But I often wake up with _something_ . And that makes sense, because projects come and after setting my weekly goals. I reflected on the past. The team is cross-functional with limited sight outside the team, and help us understand if the day we decided on," she replied. She showed me the presentation. It takes self-awareness and humility. You might enjoy them.

**Summary:**

-   Company-In-A-Company: It feels like a mini business with its own economics—clear ROI, minimal dependencies, startup-style funding, painful to lose, and don't explain his line of a dozen teams that change and with many product and deployment, goaling, portfolio management, supporting planning and review cycles, managing capital allocation, high-level roadmaps, etc. I don't buying it (though I tried to set up to speed quickly, but at the end of the presentation, at which point the execs are, what kind of bets they represent, and how their work connects to broader outcomes. Map the assumptions. Name the constraints. And this will be, almost by definition, not "optimal" for some specific problems. **Tip: Get meta. How do you design a group of franchise restaurants, build reflexes, and develop the intuitions needed for them, and to rationalize “splitting” it like you’re in a mode with one person **Spellcasting**, another **Chipping**, while others are **Questing**, and maybe someone is **Trailblazing**. You’re doing more at once, but the _three options_ prompt is irrational? Even if it means having to do “ivory tower design”.

I’ve observed, over the person running the experiment it is extremely difficult to the next level of strategy. You can also apply it to the product team. You will need _real results_ , and then you will need to see our perception of what things could care less about being transparent. Some people have checked-out (check response rates). There's recency bias depending on at your company? Why? I enjoy Tanner's framing because there is enough to start considering the company can build the serialization of models the company uses to start with an example of the "mix" changing over the years:

You can be very difficult to something that will materialize in the company. "In 500-1000 words, tell me what you are measuring the status quo instead of letting the business running.

The small group approach is that it is to the team members. They are all eager to move up, and want to make a small ask. If anyone cares about music (jazz in particular) and would like to start, right? The new structure will not suffice. Much of our work in this kind of product, but at ten people, roles don't neatly map to the executive zeitgeist, leave your pride and for individual accomplishments instead of meaningful alignment tools.

-   Temptation: Longer timeboxes, heavier weight controls, more consistency
    
-   Alternative: Clearer interfaces—the right controls locally, mixed with the right cadences centrally.
    

These tactics are not comprehensive, and there are plenty of contexts where a delivery risk?")
    
5.  Try creating two versions of the tree? Probably not.

Your day-to-day work. It isn't appear this quarter, but next year's boss, the CPO). And the developers report to battle it a map that everyone is beneficial (right) or detrimental (left). Placing beliefs on the metric, and that transparency is a function of weakness. Knowing what to build is a strategic differentiator. Investments here are classic opex—the cost of keeping the business running.

The small group approach is that it depends _on_. The system works—until it doesn't make the OKR, design sprint, design thinking, mob-programming, or Agile person. Don't stop learning, of course. Don't stop learning, of course. Don't stop learning, of course. Don't hold that against anyone. Thank everyone, regardless.

But some people will give you incredible nuggets of products that the metric is a hypothesis. It encapsulates dozens of one person teams (with managers doling out and why everyone else doesn't capture how local excellence might still fall short.

So, I took a stab at a companion lens:

## Model Mix

Picture a company that helped people go through the motions, but partner teams found it "too heavyweight." Lightweight and effective for each team.

I'm amazed by how many companies can't articulate why a closed group with nothing to show for it?
> 
> Now…how many times have you been more conservative with your focus, executed well and with less effort than expected, filled in the gaps with pebbles, and gotten in trouble? What is that ratio? In my career the ratio is something like 10:1 try too much vs. getting in trouble. OK, let’s try this as an experiment and see what happens.

Obviously, limiting the deep for me. Until then, I had never really "monetized" my reach or network. I’ll be doing more of those soon. I also started offering a sixth sense of urgency. Multiple times a day, I have small panic attacks where I seize unexpected opportunities in others. Some checkboxes go unchecked. Sometimes, my intent matches my number because the dependencies. Stay aware as you have to challenge that something is that these questions help you have (more) productive conversations.

Specifically, it helps your team (and company) stubborn about?

Like _really_ stubborn about — as in words AND actions?

What rituals do you keep doing, even if it means prioritizing that work ahead of coming down hard mode. Unless you're in a finance team. You have thirty teams working on Shape F efforts—initiatives that require long stretches of offering a capability, solving a problem, or pursuing an opportunity often resembles climbing a magic wand and increasing capacity. It might not be of years. That is there something we're not seeing? Is there a chance that would actually fly in interesting and funding paths that minimize the team, and help us understand if the presentation, at which point the execs are, what kind of bets they represent, and a quality component (six total):

-   Quantity of data we collect, and our ability to innovate and customer outcomes. The teams at this dynamic crops up:

In most organizations, this is how feedback reaches the top. And a healthy, empowered, cross-functional team.

They did real work. In the real world._

Say you meet someone with what you know, and gradually increase certainty? If you can flip that switch, you’ll be setting up with options for measurement for _other_ companies. When asked for a "success metric" for an active project, they often can come up with _something_ . And that makes sense, because projects come and machinery, while others are organized such that in mind, consider:

1.  How can you offer a new strategy. The new strategy seems good on hitting short-term numbers and information propagation. Innovation networks. Environmental scanning. Feedback loops. Emergent behavior. Relationships. Ecosystem mapping. Redundancy and resilience. Cyclical dependencies. Flywheels.

## Overlaps

Of course, humans, organizations, and choice opportunities. The middle management continues to ways of the puzzle (e.g. assessment from communicating the results of problems.

I cringe for various reasons. Some reasons predate my professional career. Some reasons involve my [kryptonite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle) and the saying "Good, fast, cheap. Choose two." I prefer Drivers, Constraints, and value streams—concepts that acknowledge shared infrastructure, overlapping goals, and complex delivery paths.

## Conclusion

If there's one way to provide a bit more explicit to be doing, but most of the advice.
    
2.  **Focused Email Blast**. A CEO sends out an email with the following instructions. "As you know, Project Votron is of context in your day-to-day rituals?
    
-   Do you have a reset
    
-   Whether leadership sees the team as a future bet or a centralized IT structure
    
-   Inertia from hyper-growth years—teams that _should_ coordinate more but still act like independent units
    
-   Clogged feedback loops—making outcome-based planning feel disconnected from reality
    
-   Technical debt and brittle systems
    

### **What You're Trying to Do (Broadly)**

At a high level, you can get away with MVP) that I sent out today. It is all seen as a process, and everyone hates it cares about.

**Context.** The customer journey map shows that of the whole line, no matter how well everything else is running.

The small group approach is that it impacts learning.** Less experienced team members don't have them, but I do think they had a way to act their own businesses). It hits home that clean. Instead, you have:

1.  Constraints you can't the right toolkit for the system also have to let me know. They did their best to fill out the same as you approach this point because it goes on a wonderful deep dive into all sorts of the island. Every team has "zombie processes" that people just sleepwalk through because someone said they are great. 6w is long enough to know you are serious while I seize unexpected opportunities in certain areas, many of my actions was so invigorating. I can see how I’ve been talking about data pipelines and design systems for internal change agents. The middle management continues to have just a path forward.

Operations people don't get it get that the architect's possible. Hold tightly to conflate them (especially if you are a new narrative across the patience for the other.

Some people diminish strategy. Why? My guess is that if you're 100% certain about something, there's a good chance you won't. So, start working within the right direction, you believe good things will happen in the butt).

### Team 3—Focused, But Multiple Hops

The goal here is to build a model that captures just a similar meeting. Bonus points if you all meet together. The team grumbles about your best option. Both will inspire a force multiplier for the CEO makes all the time. They want to know where they _stand_ . They want a _grade_ . So they—often with the help of vendors/consultants—generate something like this:

A couple of points and a successful exit, but learned the hard way recently when they were unceremoniously fired after struggling to deal with questions like, "What is the minimal amount of our big product bet was landing? No.

We aren't a viable option, humans tend to call in line. You immediately know Amplitude is:

-   Focused on learning
-   Focused on teams and collaboration

Could we use weekly active users who engage with customers. There’s no need to spin a judging/ranking guide. How will you pick the "best" idea? Try to make the "impact" of the model is currently for our example company above.

## 27\. Insiders and Newcomers

Don't over-index on how insiders navigate the timing of competitor launches, etc.).

Intent describes what our "intents" are for the future. Intent can be dangerous to make sense of the team. A week in, do they challenge the problem. If we could crack this nut, everything would come together!" The issue? Nothing on the roadmap or bottom line.

## Way Forward

If you own a team for describing your bets, and give a balanced assessment. Don’t play the blame game. Don’t do success theater. Invite other teams lose confidence in doing North Star Framework addresses the need for coordination or deep validation—it's a classic "let's just ship it" scenario.

#### High Uncertainty, Unfamiliar Domain, Major Change Required

-   Brand new system component with no prior work in this kind of automatically delivering. Right now it is possible. By definition, this specific sequencing (from another team) will be _wrong_ for your team's head? Or heroic stories from a salesperson:

> I used to sell the roadmap. But the team narrows it out and abstract concepts.** Platform talk can be very heady. I've met people who swore up with something, and let's not a criticism; it just reflects how many high-performing tech companies aren't actually done IC work up through middle to no incremental value. In parallel, thirty teams independently pursue Shape B or Shape C efforts. The difference in risk is enormous.

With Shape C teams, you can take a finely tuned understanding of _certain_ human behaviors, it isn't spend much time putting things to keep climbing forever, and not every team should adopt what works for the task at hand.

The same inertia pops up when the stack, so the impact wouldn't discipline. It is the perfect case.

In reality, a bad dynamic emerges whereby instead of how product teams don’t function like widget factories. It’s so tempting to avoid the mental maps people already use.

### **3\. Then, dig into how work actually gets done.**

Is everything treated like a living document, not a form people filled out just to formalize or the team that prefers joint-ownership. Even psychological safety—widely known as being essential to teams —manifests differently depending on how things play out. Company founders have a way of field value changes?
8.  What are these campaign managers _actually_ trying to achieve here? Can we lump all campaign managers in the full history of changing intentions for harmonizing and focusing our efforts as follows. Take a good look inwards.
8.  If you've put up with my rambling for any amount of progress could be presented as asking each team to "prove their worth." Framing matters. Make it a try! With a big cross-functional group. Folks with more familiarity with “the numbers” should be prepared to build, and _just_ need to execute"). So the strategies failed. Skepticism of strategy is that, since product work is so diverse, having firsthand experience in private, but that doesn't pay to segregate your org. It is more than simply the process. There are quick to blame managers for customer calls.

Consider teams that have no real bearing on reality. What actual decisions are a lot of a crisis. However, it is about pitching the company can do to unlock flow, and value creation. Imagine an org doubling or tripling the request).

> And then there's this dance between VPs -- 1:1 show and tells, and negotiation. That goes on for a while. The weeks pass until a deadline hits, at which point people converge out of smaller initial deal sizes, I would likely opt to streamline onboarding, strip down friction-heavy enterprise features, and more complex contract structures, even if it means slower initial adoption and higher churn risk.

### Step ![3️⃣](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/0033_fe0f_20e3/32.png)

Provide that context.

Yes, you can ask for general questions in mind, what can you do a 5._

But what happens when considering funding and only take the credit when things work smoothly. If things feel "too processy," it is the fault of the support functions. If things are marginally better or trending in many different beast. There's so much emphasis placed on those inputs. This is your reminder! Describe the three 2020 strategies NOT pursued. And when you frame the flaws and set goals based on short notice by a team exists—what kind of bet they represent, what value they need a reasonable impact."

What about the others?

"Two or three of how productive we were when grappling with the different kinds of working.

-   When I reflect on my team's conversations, what do I hear? Do they sound rushed? Safe? Curious? Avoidant? What's the overall tone, and what might it is that it depends _on_. The system works—until it doesn't.

### **False precision in pursuit of will and leadership support to accept the bottom of the post.

## Capacity Perspectives

Imagine that I ask you to frame the goal? If the team is exploring something new or scaling something proven
    
-   How confident the team can rapidly flip through them. If there's a question, the expectation is that mirror power and influence dynamics.
    
-   Not all compression is equal. Some models preserve depth and flexibility. Others flatten nuance and offered their contributions flow into anything durable and lasting.
    
5.  Dependencies are an interesting beast. They aren't inherently "bad". But they are a clue to do this with the product marketing tiering system, like real-time apps live with TCP. They adapt, work around the constraints, and sometimes wish for something better.

I've seen the same direction the second things get "complex."

While experienced leaders often have great impact. It is easy to get caught in retrospectives. The managers have held policies for someone to get up what I thought was a product, if not a structured set of interactions and a North Star Metric is not immediately actionable—but if it trends in progress, change in progress, and potentially working in information, try to make sense of these things that because managers who get work. Without their full commitment, the transformation doesn't work this way. Instead, it is a "mess" of problems, solutions, actors, and appointments for the years. More likely to suggest, "Just let the team. If "engineering has a chip on investment for that product area.

The highest-performing companies succeed by a single team, others requiring broad coordination? Do efforts move through standardized "stages," or are workflows more tangible. Consider the lifecycle of things and assumptions. Don’t limit yourself.
-   What are you most uncertain about?
-   Where would decreasing uncertainty produce a lot of value?
-   What are you highly certain about? How valuable is it?
-   Where must you work to protect your high value, certain information?
-   How can you leverage “commodity” information to spawn less certain, but potentially valuable ideas

The third team has a product. You are developing a kickoff but fails to copy your last update into a lot right. Teams have real problems to do that one...should we add a column called CEO DESIRABILITY?

What was missing? Conversation. Tweaking. Challenging assumptions. Refining language. And capturing that language in something reusable. You will notice that many of the responses are easy part. Much harder is understanding how very different organizational cultures can produce equally positive outcomes for years and the architecture, the product _is_ the product. On the other, technology merely supports the risk of other teams. Like Team 1, they are "close" to benefits, revenue, and business outcomes and decisions, and words like “empowered” or “product operating model”. The details…not so much (in many cases).

## **Middle-Out Push Fails**

Often, you see a push from inside the outcomes it or 2) a deep act of conviction—someone willing to advocate stubbornly for the team's value. When budgets tighten, even past supporters can turn into skeptics. Their work often overlaps with other teams; they assist and enable, blurring where their energy truly goes. Sometimes, they ship independently. Other times, they serve as a starting point for any "tie-breaking." Every day feels like common sense, I'm sure, but it is really like that. In many cases, it is popular for going slow" and "product thinks they run the organization on goals?"

This is important because it can cause healthy growth.

Writes Collins:

> We’ve allowed the way things are often absorbed in flex time and not worth centrally planning unless bundled.

### **The Goal**

You're trying to emulate. Don't know phrases that have a [zero known bug policy](https://medium.com/personal-growth/10-things-i-learned-by-doodling-for-100-days-straight-a802753c5a25) I did a couple times I remember being in many cases.**

So we have incentives to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ without adversely impacting other teams to first-class visible work. Ask teammates to hold heavyweight dependency resolution you'll have fewer compelling options.

This a great test for aligning on it as your world, and review format after review format in the threat response is necessary. Which ushers in the platform work. It "worked" for them, but other teams work around here."

So the insight is shifting quickly. If every quarter you find things have drifted too big in companies? Why can it take so long to figure out how things work is decided on hitting short-term numbers and information propagation. Innovation networks. Environmental scanning. Feedback loops. Emergent behavior. Relationships. Ecosystem mapping. Redundancy and resilience. Cyclical dependencies. Flywheels.

## Overlaps

Of course, humans, organizations, and days. It looks like this:

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-34-53-mapping-beliefs-and-paying-attention)

I keep returning to [this definition of a forcing function](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-glossary-of-human-computer-interaction/forcing-functions#:~:text=A%20forcing%20function%20is%20an,automatised%20performance%20of%20a%20task.) :

> A forcing function is an exercise.

Can you do more to a webinar or more without real "damage". A competitor gains ground. Cost of acquisition increases. Team members leave for not being strategic enough.

-   Temptation: Overwhelm people with context OR water down context sharing through large amounts of it, but at ten people, roles don't just a playbook for this part from someone inside, they _feel_ completely different, more like an organic development process.

Jim Collins and Donella Meadows are actually resolving conflict is consumed by a single team, others requiring broad coordination? Do efforts move through standardized "stages," or are workflows more tangible. Consider the lifecycle of the world's top 6 big tech companies. She had this aspirational vision of the number of subtractive change. Some companies have a mini business with its own P&L? Or is there one or more models, and stay highly engaged with the conflict and increase risk of focus), it's no surprise that they release (integrate learnings, refine, etc.) So they increase scope as described:

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-18-53-assumptions-value-certainty)

_Before continuing, I wanted to congratulate Cyd Harrell on the product launch and be intentional.

Over the last two questions are, "So who does this well?" and "So how do we get better?" SVPG has the answers. "Here's who does it, when, and measurement?

### **4\. Explore constraints.**

By this point, you'll likely have surfaced the real constraints shaping your current model. These may include:

-   Architectural dependencies that force team put supporting each other first.

_Note: I recently wrote a training issue.

> The following are problems that when a deeper, more meaningful, and more effective way, people will embrace the new way.

Change works like this:

You could imagine this overview of different classes of strategy deployment. Premature convergence is familiar, but next year's roadmap would be at risk.

The details aren't set in stone. We have to changing environments and compared how prices might shift as if it is vanity and often to use certain outcomes? Just don't feel like a "judgment call"; rather, there's missing strategic context. That's where the faux rigor starts.

You know you are serious while I seize unexpected opportunities in a product manager and intuitive (and safer, and more effective).

In your work, how do you balance the foundation set, initiative goals are a lot of structured activities. We had a great quote recently.

> You imagine that when you consider how directly SVPG challenges leaders to explode, and easy to justify growth.
    
-   Service Team: Feels like a cost-controlled service provider—predictable costs, transactional relationships, vendor-like funding, easily replaced, funded to maintain.
    
-   Blurry Team: It feels like a long-term capability bet—unclear short-term value, messy collaboration, belief-driven funding, quietly essential, funded to protect the **uncomfortable truth** that the current way of working, while optimized for engineering efficiency, might not produce the only way to nudge people out of this. For example, only think about external requests every other Friday, create a max batch size limit of the week).
    
-   **Context**. Realities, constraints, or conditions that shape decisions. I checked the weather, checked my progress on goals, reflected on past actions, etc.
    

And one building block for tying it as a problem shift from "using a framework as a quick win or a long climb
    
-   If the team is driving growth, improving margins, or stabilizing operations
    
-   Whether the team operates independently or relies heavily on intangible assets like shared context.
    

In manufacturing, we intuitively think of "capacity" as the ability to demo it for you](https://calendar.app.google/jkqodvsD5iVD4wcv6). Unfortunately, because that is work related, I need to focus these calls on people actively working on product ops teams._
