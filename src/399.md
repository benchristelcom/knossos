# Arc Coordination System - Project Summary

## Testing Workflows Locally

### During Execution
- Creates PRs in each agent
- Filter by status (pending, funded, settled, cancelled)
- Each PR gets isolated database
- Tests run on: Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.10, 3.9, 3.11
- This creates noisy console errors even though the app handles auth correctly
- Multi-asset support
- Timeout-based heap structures (max for bids, min for asks)
- Operating_Mode: 0 (POSITION mode)
├── zh_permission.json   # Permission names in English (usually empty)
```

### Side Menu Implementation Pattern
```bash
# Dashboard → Backups → Select backup → Make Public
```

### Streamlit Not Loading

**Tools**:
1. `check_actor_reputation` - Actor history and payment submission
✅ Missing intents in feature groups
cd ../my-feature

# AI Enhancement (OPTIONAL - can run without)
agentman create

# Arc Network
retrieval:
  1. Running `databricks apps list` to verify app appears
  if (typeof Deno !== "undefined") return "deno";
  // @ts-ignore
  else:
      throw new Error(`Unsupported runtime: ${runtime}`);
  }
}
```

## Format-Specific Metadata Mapping

✓ **Error Handling**
- Files from backup that don't require RMT5 hardware will run more smoothly in QEMU
