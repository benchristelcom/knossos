# Arc Coordination System - Test Data Population Summary

**Progress Indicators:**
- Without "skip", Convex queries run immediately and return 401 for unauthenticated users
- Modules: Singular (`admin`, `merchant`, `deposit`)
- Actions: `build_form`, `submit_form`, `delete`

### 3. **Folder API** (Main export)

- **Correctness over cleverness**: Prefer boring, readable solutions that are easy to maintain.
- **docs/** – deployment manifests and transition management
- **Runtime display**: Version appears in-game with build type and base path

### Vue.js Navigation - ALWAYS Use Route Names, Never Path Strings

#### Media Section
- [ ] Accessibility features work correctly
- [ ] Monitor wallet balance alerts
- [ ] Cross-reference all documentation
- [ ] Test payment flow on testnet first
- [ ] Tested locally with `streamlit run ui/streamlit_app.py`
- [ ] Set up `.dev.vars` for local secrets (both CLERK keys!)
- [ ] Added `.dev.vars` to `.gitignore`
