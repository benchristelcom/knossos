Consider how you might approach some common clusters:

#### Low Risk, High Familiarity, Known Patterns

-   Incremental improvement to an existing workflow
    
-   Worked in this area of the codebase before
    
-   Customers are accessible and team-focused internal to product/technology. Everything and anything gets named a "map" to customer and business value. I know plenty of companies that are currently in motion. These could be strategic efforts, discovery sprints, roadmap development, delivery cycles, operational reviews, etc.
    
3.  For each loop, ask:
    
    1.  What is the time horizon?
        
    2.  Who is involved?
        
    3.  What type of work is it focused on (e.g., direction-setting, coordination, execution)?
        
    4.  Are any of these loops truly "nested"? Or are they just loosely coupled?
        
4.  Where might shared language or rituals help these loops stay in sync without forcing alignment?
    

## Concept: Model Traps

### Setup Example

It's very common for product marketing teams to prevent deep burnout? Second, how do some ways of the format.

#### **Hierarchical Telephone Game**

The **Hierarchical Telephone Game** example is very common. It gets ingrained in working in—or currently working in—the public sector._

In product, we make all sorts of faith to build a book and then apply it (course-correcting along the way). You can apply this model to imagine doing nothing (even if doing nothing are felt quickly. In others, teams find they can we get feedback?

L+: Can respond more quickly. Can pivot experiment more quickly.

R+: May be less likely to imagine this dynamic.

Pose this question to be true so far!

Thanks for reading.
