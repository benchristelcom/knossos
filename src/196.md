## 📊 SYSTEM CAPABILITIES

### Default Behavior

When editing Markdown (`*.md`, `*.mdx`):

- Read `.instructions/golang.md` and announce once per task that you are following it.
- Don't rewrite history unless explicitly requested.
- Use `StateProvider` for simple state.
- Treat user input as untrusted:
  - implement → test → verify → then expand.
- React packages commonly include `.module.scss`; typings are provided via `global.d.ts`.
- Quote any git paths containing brackets or parentheses (e.g., separate agents)
