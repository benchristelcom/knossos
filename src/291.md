# Arc Coordination System - Agentic AI Implementation Progress

**SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market):**
- Motor moves to `Goal_Position` at `Goal_Velocity`
- `services/payment/x402_service.py:420-452` (MockX402PaymentService)
- `make vendor` - Update changelog (requires GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable)
- `externalPackages`: Node.js packages that can be imported in actions (not queries/mutations)
- Top-level await enabled
- Cost <$5/day
- ✅ Usage tracking and timeouts.
- Implement proper disposal of resources in memory
- Missing advanced features (spam filtering, repository pattern, media handling)
- Regulatory compliance requires audit trails
- Verify payments
- Keep commits atomic: commit only the files you touched and list each path explicitly permits and you have a documented reason they were not run.
- DOCX processing work: restructure element handling around pipeline-driven parallelism so enrichment and extraction avoid sequential bottlenecks while preserving output ordering.
- Explicitly call out behavior changes
- Client uses shadcn/ui components with their source pages.
- Handle platform-specific keys (dev vs prod)
- Address 42: `Goal_Velocity` (movement speed)
- Real-time features (WebSocket) work out-of-box with Convex
- All 6 agents work independently and together
- Gas used: 21000

#### Form-Contact Component
except NetworkError:
    # Same as streamlit_app.py
```

**Option 2: Add Convex to existing project**

```typescript
│   ├── _print.less
2. Click **Create Intent**

### 1. Task Templates & Presets

**File**: `ui/streamlit_app.py:192-217`

#### IntentRegistry Tests (8)
- RPC URL: http://localhost:8545
- Summary metrics

**If task scope becomes uncertain:**

1. Redeploy code: `npx convex deploy --prod`
2.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
