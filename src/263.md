# Arc Coordination System - Agentic AI COMPLETE ✅

**Example**:
```
START
  test coverage over time.
- Place new modules beside the long space before `Add`.
- Domains covered: Taiwan-focused payments, invoices, logistics, SMS, storage, CMS/NestJS modules, image processing, order builder, Vault secrets, and React component kits.
- Disk-first refactors: put shared disk/workspace helpers into shared abstractions instead of relying on hidden side effects.
- Implement proper spacing and alerting
- Keep match_count low (2-5) for focused results

## Key Decisions Made

### 10. Build Complete Graph (`services/langgraph/graph.py`)
- [ ] Code is formatted (`dart format .`)
- [ ] App builds successfully on target platforms
- [ ] Agent tool reference
- [ ] Template application: < 100ms
- [ ] POST `/ai/analyze` - Analyze intent with full agent workflow
- [ ] Fraud Agent provides accurate price analysis
- [ ] Add entry point (matching_agent)
- [ ] Follow existing directory structure
- [ ] Show successful match reasons
- [ ] Full workflow executes
- [ ] Audit logging for team workspace actions
- [ ] Merge image.rst
  - Renditions and responsive images
  - Performance architecture
  - GitHub Actions uses tobozo/esp32-qemu-sim which is not available for local use

### VS Code

Before submitting, ensure:
- [ ] All tests pass (`flutter test`)
- [ ] UI components implemented in agents-manage-ui
- [ ] Market leadership position

**Deployment Complete!** 🎉

❌ **Use regular branches when:**
- Clear cache and liquidity analysis
- Smart Project Scanner
- ✅ Scalable architecture

### Test Transaction Links

See **[A2A_X402_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md](./A2A_X402_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md)** for:
- Tool functions execute normally
- Load both backend and details

### Key Configuration Files
- **`render.sh`**: Processes templates using Python/Jinja2

### 2. Triage Checklist (Use in Order)
bun run release

# Using standard Maven (slower)
./mvnw clean package -pl :seatunnel-dist -am -D"skip.ui"=true -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Prelease
```

### Testing

```bash
# .env additions
pip list | grep streamlit

# Format code
5. **File Converters** (`file-converter-*`): Image processing utilities (resize, transcode, watermark)
3. ⬜ Create Fraud Agent (2-3 hours)
import {
  data: currentProductionPromptData,
  outputPath: string,
) {
  const output = createWriteStream(outputPath);
  expect(aliceTasks).toHaveLength(1);
  const deleteTask = useMutation(api.tasks.remove);

  // Action hook - for external API calls
  max_bytes: 10485760           # 10MB max file size
  ↓
  ↓
archon:manage_task(action="list", filter_by="project", filter_value="...")`
3. Identify next priority task: Find highest `task_order` in "todo" status
RISK_THRESHOLD=70  # 0-100
class RiskAgent:
    def __init__(self, llm):
        self.llm = llm

    async def detect_fraud(self, state):
        """Periodic AI-powered fraud detection (background job)"""
        # Runs once per hour, not per match
        state = await fetch_current_state()

        # Run agents
        elif task_type in ["matching", "risk", "settlement"]:
            return await self.call_gemini(prompt)

        # Send to interested users
        2. Fair market price
        data={
            "payment_required": True,
            "tx_hash": tx_hash,
            "tx_hash": tx_hash,
            "payment_request": payment_request
        },
        reasoning="Payment required before settlement execution"
    )

async def handle_payment_submission(
    self,
    max_gas_price_gwei=None  # Use network price
)

# Low-level: Specific API usage, syntax, configuration
while `bs` is small it *may* have some confusing parts. Here's how it's all layed out:

```text
6. **Payments**: Payment intent creation and parsing
const taglib = await taglib.open("audio.mp3");
```

### Preparing for Offline

```typescript
ccremote --help
```

## Context Management

Once complete, explore the **6 result tabs**:

#### Phase 1: Pre-settlement
- Test in production-like environment
- For Content Creators
- Constants
- AI reasoning for fraud detection

#### ⚠️ Tab 3: Risk Assessment
- Settlement with transaction being included in blocks
- Configuration management
- Real-time updates across all pages
- ✅ Mock service for testing, debugging, iteration
- Production optimization

**Solution**: Restart services to pick up new `.env` configuration:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/matches | jq

# With bindings (D1, KV, etc.)
├── Makefile           # Build and test commands
public function getRelatedData($relatedKey) {
    await Promise.all(batch.map(/* same processing */));
  }
}
```

### Streaming Export to JSON Lines

```python
# Generate TypeScript types from JSONL file
the next week to minimize slippage. I'm okay with 2% worse price
└── types.py                    # Type definitions and aliases

1. **Payment Adapters** (`payments-adapter-*`): Unified payment interfaces for settlement coordination services instead of 0.01 ETH.

## SSL/TLS with Let's Encrypt

Railway will detect multiple services. Add:

**Core Infrastructure:**
- `folder="article"` - Requires "Manage page" permission
- `agent/`: Core implementation with `agent.py`, `fastagent.config.yaml`, and `prompt.txt`

### Q: Workflow stuck on one agent?
**A**: Click directly on the expandable header section

## Vector Search

**Actions Completed**:
1. Hardcoded gas price (50 Gwei) doesn't adapt to network conditions
🛡️ Fraud (checks)
  ↓
test(models): add comprehensive user model tests
pkill -f anvil
│  │   RLM       │◄──────────────────────────►  LMHandler           │ │
6. Both parties accept (would have failed with rigid matching)
```

**Best of Both Worlds**:
- Higher settlement success rate
- Keep match_count low (2-5) for focused results

## 🎨 Professional Streamlit Dashboard

Restart Mayor session:

```toml

**Tasks**:
1. Matching BID @ $10,100 against ASK @ $10,000
