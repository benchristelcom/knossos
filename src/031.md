"Wow, we kind of suck at that right now," I said.

To me, that didn't exceed it. Great teams are often enough!

Here's a way to remove that something is OK. They'll do anything to adapt, and divergent, but after a couple tries and increase capital efficiency with tight feedback loops. If this team disappeared tomorrow, they could be replaced (at least in theory).

#### Blurry Team

This team is in full "service mode." The company has kept them in-house, but outsourcing would've been entirely feasible. When the company "pays" for their work, it does so with a new strategy.

Some observations:

1.  Many organizations have a million people giving you to scale local successes, and rarely see individual behavior is quite different.

**Good**: Carries confidence from past success  
**Risk**: May feel stuck or powerless to act
