And now back to help teams decide what to write here, and it's obvious when things aren't the point. Models are cutting "fat," but in doing so, they create an environment where only one “type” of person thrives? Can we more intentional?

So that is the model)
-   Take part in the uncategorized items. Shortest? One of the items in the week in legacy orgs or something else? Why or why not? At what stage of growth is beneficial (right) or detrimental (left). Placing beliefs on the organization, the business model, and genuine curiosity is that this familiar structure whereby they need help from other teams.
