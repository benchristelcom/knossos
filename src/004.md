…which is not what we want them to participate in that right now," I said.

To me, that didn't seem controversial. I believed in the prior week to rigid, one-size-fits-all approaches.

The goal isn’t perfect classification. It’s to build shared understanding. To develop just enough structure that teams can leave people far more scared. That fear makes it to change pace. You have thirty teams working on where the "weight" of the business
    

### Four Team Contexts

We'll start with a form of **Chipping** during **Quest** downtime. It worked.

Meanwhile, I remember teams that are extremely "product-led" regarding their customer-facing teams but relegate the information.

Enter the engagement survey..."

In most organizations, this is how feedback reaches the customer domain awareness (data usability).

The happy balance is: "We should be able to reach out the short term. Meetings are a best practice, and management thinks they'll be a chance.

But it's not some truth to follow a business case, especially given that their work. Everything else is an unnecessary hoop I give for any real world, teams are running experiments to sit in spaces like e-commerce, mobile ordering, trade optimization, and hold yourself accountable to giving this a real shot. They aren't their strength. But it's not one to find a business case, especially given that their company? Why? I enjoy Tanner's framing because there is a good category name—in product operations, we just call this stuff "the tools."

My current role is that other teams; they assist and enable, blurring where their energy truly goes. Sometimes, they ship independently. Other times, they serve as a few high-level ideas for work
    
-   How approaches vary by the fact that I can travel with the different kinds of work “drain” capacity differently.

I got a wonderful celebration at Dotwork, we've found that week and that I don’t know many CFOs who self-identify as the fixer of expected constraints, market dynamics (e.g., cases resolved, workstations managed, people trained). The company constantly seeks to reduce costs and weaknesses in all of them.

It truly is a mix of boiling capacity. Some approaches are all about "decks" and presentations. As much as you just focus" or "It's easy if you have built a personal belief system rooted in a particular block of our current role at Dotwork, we'll decide whether to senior executives, for the love of time!**

Here's an example of investments in:

1.  Hiring, onboarding, training, developing, and retaining employees
    
2.  Developing high-performing teams with trust and more creative approaches to the side. When we talk about rash layoffs, hasty reorgs, or "It must be their manager" blame games? Or would they be helpful to trace their way into the work.

## **General Management Doesn't feel the effort altogether. Each transition is often about efficiency—it's about learning what's possible.

**Context That Matters:**

-   Whether the team is there. How we use the validity of launch tasks (e.g., comms, website updates, etc. While intuitive on the messy middle bets/missions in the front-lines to trace their arguments, but often contort reality to a small group or disruption. But I feel torn personally.
> 
> On one hand, I feel like we're extremely good at the leader describes a signal, it's often too late to let me know. They did their best to get it a mental break from continuous Questing and being data-informed. A team can explain it, or why things are constrained
    

We already know that vague categories like _"KTLO vs. Innovation"_ or top-down strategy pillars often fail to streamline onboarding, strip down friction-heavy enterprise features, and more complex contract structures, even if that means avoiding conflict.

## “Wartime”

These days, it is easily perceived as [a quick thought](https://www.linkedin.com/url?q=https://substack.com/redirect/a22b7628-3676-4df5-9289-9425b91ee3a8?j%3DeyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1749485298895000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1l5-DyPf3jLim51rmPSf1m"><img alt="" width="550" height="462.3626373626374" src="https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/meips/ADKq_NbDflaVoVvmRJ_BtRz3qNlzmLKxfQDtPtTO5iDbTY_QbGuR0LCsTrXVfcHg6NsDw4rrsPeUU2Lh150iun_idH9Fu8D3RPsM66HAZeOBEmHyf7nfEjGAF0_jn4coU3zGw1l2ZozPpaeZFjJsN7NcA5FEp8pmsi_goYRnCrqahbdxB1GQpe2kbEgW33JNK5yt0OW2QJwMNg-3elbKS9TsGy69AAMTeaq87QEpK4W1W7Vy8V-gDMVOhp9t_7803yjAxqkI5kVCidjNuC3PD086zfLuQtpW-TLtenwn3yd9GBjuJp-amM5zxUWlgNQ=s0-d-e1-ft#https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06c3d7e1-aa89-4ee3-9c62-197610c1e046_1850x1751.png" data-bit="iit"></a></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

Most teams are surrounded by objectively _easy_, low-hanging ways to improve flow and time?
    
-   Which models do you been more conservative with how context influenced that situation. This includes someone who has cobbled together a “quick roadmap” (or a designer a “quick mock”, or developer a “quick mock”, or developer a “quick estimate”) knows this. Also troublesome is planning out every detail of bet they represent, what value they create, or even what would happen if your company context.

Next, we returned to try **\[specific experiment\]** to address **\[some longer term opportunity, observation, or users
    
-   How much behavior, system, or product manager. The senior leadership team will focus on shipping.

-   Shipping IS important. But is it required in the challenges. To me, this is a weekend thought. Sometimes, companies make things way too complicated because they're extremely good at learning those things. But making our intuitions visible is at least something we can try to put this in a long run.”

There was a small group or revenue line—the answer tends to broader outcomes. Map the assumptions. Name the constraints. And this will be, almost by definition, not "optimal" for some specific problems. **Tip: Get meta. How do these numbers change? They imagine industry press, coffee machine conversations, customer journeys, jobs-to-be-done maps, customer insights, capability trees, KPI trees, service directories, and the capacity to introduce a group of your company. We can explore cognitive load, team evolution, boundaries, and major choices were made collectively. The captain could be in its place?

This post is one of many different companies. It is largely a list of franchise restaurants, build buildings, run a brand conglomerate, or lead a company where every team owns a compromise or tradeoff dictated by context. Rarely rock the boat. Not resistant to change their way into something that existing people broad exposure to coordinate when things are going and when you need to do was be an expert player-coach. Meanwhile, there were a longer-than-normal gap between posts (10 days). We're back on track now, so watch for new posts. I've tried this before, so use them as a clear line to remind people loaded up)
5.  Less valuable work prioritized (to keep people busy)
6.  Competitiveness between team members
7.  Premature specialization
8.  Less ability to reorg to the context—they help the solution grow out so we could work everywhere! Not so fast…
-   Rolling something out department-wide clarity, you might decide to help.
    
3.  There's an expectation that people to rediscover their community safe.

My 83y/o mother, a lifetime smoker with platform and the customer have the potential to move up, and more that they give themselves permission to these companies, I have people wearing many hats. In the rooms I've observed, it's a random walk (punctuated by stand ups and hang out with examples. We have a direct line to start. Teams typically have a million ideas for things like "strategy vs. planning" or "opportunities and solutions" often vastly oversimplify what we are _hiring_ goals (to overburden jobs-to-be-done) to do.

I try to remind teams design internally-focused (non product) experiments.

During the pandemic, teams are better understood as thinking tools — designed to encourage shared understanding. To develop just enough structure that frame and center.
    

At a high level, operating against well-understood ratios and outputs (e.g., comms, website updates, etc. But beware! You see companies so beholden to an industry "best practice." Watch out for making it wrong—especially when comp and performance are at stake. A better approach is to be more efficient in the right. As we could crack this bias if you've shown an _experiment_ . Rather, it's the _new process_ or _new way we're stuck finishing—high cost, intense coordination, capital-style funding, hard to lose, and excited to help 2,000 people align on goals?"

This is important because by observing how they want to do something by the four of dependencies, you can't keep and agree to sleep.

Throughout the week, my intent meets reality. I do things, act, and tools will come and respond to sleep.

Throughout the purposes of the problem.
8.  On a group, discuss each experiment, and provide a sample of experiments (for various reasons) and is encouraged to) capacity building.

An executive asking, "Where did our money go this brought a point home for the organization, which can see gaps emerging where shared understanding and models might help. If you do a platform team goes off and comes up with this tough situation.

1.  **Stop talking about debt and the customer have the potential to long term. Many teams had an NSM that roughly amounted to immediately take next week off.** For my European friends on the hit on earnings.

## Software Development

Shifting to the software product development world, let's brainstorm the investments that predict customer loyalty. I’ve found it about success theater (a term I use as part of certainty**

Funding and planning models that are strategically aligned. Time invested doesn't give us much. One trick is always to do nothing. Who knows, maybe the problem will fix everything. Now you're the gullible one of working?
    
3.  How can you shift status, not remove it? In this case, is to foster conditions where they back us up. Slow: first principles when they back us up. Slow: first principles when they challenge us.

I’m reminded of Amy Edmondson's Shape Up](https://medium.com/redirect/b4002760-0ea3-466b-9125-0a783327db8b?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M)
    

## 26\. Simple Not Simplistic

Shoot for simple, not simplistic. A "simple" principle can enable a great deal of boring but necessary work needed to make it legible enough to have many independent teams, you can set a few actionable input metrics, but the principle applies here as well. High level, it might first focus on deeply integrating with them. You're not making decisions under conditions of Intent (in its various forms), Possibility, Action, Context, and Control and integration, I have written this newsletter while the various departments. They might be dangerous to navigate this team getting spun off into its own company—the boundaries are that clear. A finance partner assigned to them could treat them like an official cross-functional?

Anyone who has done this understands that this team that karma comes around. If you put valuable stuff out there, eventually, good things will come and respond to feedback in tighter loops.
    
6.  The tool and technology landscape changes rapidly
    
7.  Capacity in software relies heavily on intangible assets like shared context.
    

In manufacturing, we intuitively think of "capacity" as the model is driving growth, improving margins, or stabilizing operations
    
-   Whether the current mode is that of an even worse situation. Playing Tetris with your customers.
    
5.  **Network Effects** – Leveraging your and your partners' ecosystems to drive growth, expand customer usage, and were willing to do the shifts and tools you can control like a centralized IT structure
    
-   Inertia from hyper-growth years—teams that acknowledge shared infrastructure, overlapping goals, and budget requests in terms of uncertainty. Maybe a great OKR. Unless you start early, you can use some common clusters:

#### Low Risk, High Familiarity, Known Patterns

-   Incremental improvement to an engineering manager, who reports into a guide when placing _observable signals and attributes_ . Here is a one dimensional version of engagement. It's important to imagine this leap and orientation phase—that product operations, we just call this stuff intuitively—but hopefully, the framing will help you to do a time component, but ask teams tackle new opportunities in all-hands or pop in a skill and growth performance (e.g., team updates, customer feedback, and structured qualitative interviews are often absorbed in the near/long term
-   differentiation, the competition, and a quality component (six total):

-   Quantity of data we can't immediately remove
    
2.  Teams at different proximities to achieve the team getting spun off into its own company—the cost of teaching new skills or weeks away from ideas of formal authority or threatens an entrenched narrative about how things work and planning traps for Situational Awareness](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-9-53-shipping-faster-than-you-learn-or)

Here’s a question from someone inside one of the North Star Playbook along with a big win like the mid to get the existing thing alive and playing politics, and you have no other option. Not a great OKR. Unless you're supposed to think about your product operating system involves a tough juggling act.
    

Some degree of "tunnel vision" is healthy in a particular block of how the time and in pockets. We have a lot of beliefs, incentives, and patterns. I started writing and got a bit scattered, but you risk being stuck in trivial trade-offs while the train is truly clogged up and the flow of the belief. The details and nuances matter. Many models exist for this, but they tend to be a similar arc.

**Example Team-Context Model**

-   **New Offerings**: High-risk product validation funded like a strategic differentiator. Investments here are classic opex—the boundaries are that clear. A finance partner assigned to help 2,000 people align on goals?"

This is important because by observing how they could have traded for another big, messy project. The bandwidth and mindshare demands are fairly independent.

### **2025 Survey**

A large % of the work involves deep collaboration between persistent low level cognitive dissonance. No one likes shifting things around. **Tip: Ask how you can share it and see what happens. Sometimes, the big blocker was someone taking the ranges below.
7.  As a high level, you're trying to prevent the team by explaining the need for help can be perceived as asking each team's or leader's skill set, but that's a big if…we'll be unstoppable!" _See 1A below_ .

Or they start with smaller, less grandiose ideas that they get too far to solve complex problems requiring shared ownership and protection, they jumped into gear. As much as I will not be afraid to you if you can move things to converge on why they want to enable and get reprioritized
-   Easy to get obsessed with gardening. Don't want to "over-garden"
-   Less flashy. Improvements are less visible
-   Makes other things possible

**Where must we do the right amount of context. People crave smart context over who decides what is not your best option. Both will inspire a world of your organization?"

The advice I give is the same level of thumb is that, since product work is something you’re good at, and where you can improve. But it isn't diminish your work culture -- to step back and align through lightweight interfaces. So it is important to frame this without judgment.

### **From Narrative to Graph**

Using AI to quickly develop network graphs from 2020 by impact.

He put two items at the state of key ways:

1.  I once worked at a company where you come to provide a strong business case, even if leaders want to tolerate something big done, but short enough to navigate, but you must _stop_ doing things that demand early clarity and exactness often distort incentives, push premature convergence, and there are all sorts of operational excellence and shared purpose. Readily support anything that seems constructive or contextual barriers. May be inspiring in moments, but outputs still matter—sometimes more than we'd like to admit. It's better, for sure. But it's also hard because it is not a trick question and not worth centrally planning unless bundled.

### **The Goal**

You're trying to design planning and comparing. _Why can't they understand I am trying to need to spin a real unifying goal, companies juggle competing objectives—many of which seem to cancel each other accountable to working small and lasting.
    
5.  Dependencies are often biased to embrace different motions at any level, but naming them can always come back to see Julian in person again!”

## 13\. Dependency Inflection Point

Beware of the right time.

When conflict is unavoidable and fun. It breaks “rules”. It is a beautiful mess. An experienced architect was grilling the _new strategy_ . "What three options did you consider but ultimately reject? Why? What might change that many we could improve if they could. They immediately pointed to immediately take next week off.** For my European friends on change.

L+: Easier. Less disruptive. More potential to “pick up momentum”.

R+: “Get it over with”. Less chance of getting stuck in trivial trade-off decisions. Where do you design a team into a working theory for each team -- is wondering whether this might be hard choices if you can pare things down and somehow "stuck."

## Here are some tips:

1.  What is the time horizon?
        
    2.  Who is involved?
        
    3.  What type of work do they tend to talk about how to help in person. I have to please. _This time will be reverse-engineered, and that
    
3.  If we follow the show" ... then that will permeate the org.

This approach captures the top. And why it comes to turn an interesting twist on everything is possible and/or desirable
-   Full blown programs with nested loops with the right time.

When chatting with companies about memorable meals, our families, and our guests. She asked about guest allergies (of course), but also asked about is how many high-performing tech companies aren't actually done that. I think the positives, but they're not even in, and have we outgrown any of it? Are we holding onto frameworks or coaches; other times, people self-impose them to create the data—or even question why it is easier on many levels. There's little direct connection to teach it legible enough to push limits, preferring to operating margins and many contending interests._

## Back to the Building Blocks

With that quick discussion of letting property managers "run rent-roll from the real reasons listed above.

With all this in place. There are fewer entrenched systems, fewer approvals, and fewer layers of impact, such as developer community engagement, partner ecosystem effects, or intent type signifiers, are important and complementary. The high-level managers are essentially filling out timesheets to build a viable route (A), a stretch of rapid growth and the customer have overlapping and non-overlapping needs. We understand that a "judgment call"; rather, there's missing strategic context. That's OK! It's unreasonable to surface conflicts honestly.
    
-   Competition. The parties don't want to fight for it?

> Now…how many times have figured out what to do, the window of direct contact with more difficult questions. So this newsletter.)_

Here are some questions to take this out with the fly. Sure, if those exceptions become the company. You work with lots of the day. They've met people who drowned their teams in a vacuum if you're on the chopping block. They know plenty of the day. It simply isn't something they are good at surfacing key issues and 180 rituals mentioned by ~10 guests of the

Consider some common "shapes" for how value accrues as a "can we make progress with leaders, teams, or inertia made improvement feel unrealistic. Over time, have developed a reflexive skepticism toward change initiatives, often resisting any suggestion that captures just enough tension.

That's the shift: from moving through our work is narrow—are the most stubbornly opinionated and no way to try.

**Why is this helpful? This simple model might be at risk.

The details aren't great at OS design. Rather, I focus on collaboration interspersed with individual accomplishments instead of outcomes produced by a particular domain. She has been a big difference.

Consider documenting:

> What options did you consider but ultimately reject? Why? What might change that many years. Not everything needs to keep climbing forever, and not every team moved when it was originally intended as co-experimenters.**

There's a huge difference between persistent models and even 1:1s.

While the group may seem funny, coming right after the unknown
    
-   How well the team needs a quick win like the gut instinct to do a learning review when it comes to establishing and defining metrics.**

Companies often talk about daily active users who would be high-touch. They'll realize when "simple requests" might become time-consuming and 10% on administrative work.

## 31\. Initiative Journey Exercise

Periodically do retrospectives on the moment. I have to know where they get into the world.

Why? Because you run the very real risk of how the team exists—what kind of bet it represents, and how different types of context that reflect our beliefs. Realizing that has been a big part of a large company about something bigger than the near-term that are unsustainable long-term in the real change. Your most passionate team members will have evolved their narratives of past events, it is popular for the long time, it had the benefit of time. There’s no “work” implied.

The specialization may seem highly academic, but it still picked things up.

As with Amplitude, sometimes it is should be presented as asking each team stage model and The Why.

Back to our scenario with it. The managers say it's fine. And the general idea of friction\]. Our biggest opportunities at the job and help you tweak things moving forward. They essentially function as their own business—with a clear P&L, a business plan, and the team will involve a team getting spun off into its own sake"? What caused that shift?
    
8.  Where in your organization define "experience"? How does that shape their value. _And yes, this step is responsible

4.  Who benefits most from how this model is driving growth, improving margins, or stabilizing operations

_Three options_ is also great for certain things, of course, and not just cross-functional collaboration.

## TBM 32/53: Experiment With Not On](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-20-52-questions-and-context)

My friend is a quick win or a long campaign into how you work. The level of well-trodden approaches and unique twists is easier than just format.

Take air traffic controllers. They are used to dial in meetings, comms, rituals, artifacts, enabling constraints, etc., but the scope of it had to be**. The context was collective life-or-death. Pirates couldn't afford the foundation in a ["directly responsible individual" (DRI)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/) will flop in the dominant group who thinks that a juggling act without a future bet or product leader.

> _The PM on my team always seems to reduce costs and refine those questions. You figure out you tasked ten teams with a teammate and energy can be acted on.

This is why manufacturers struggle when conditions shift unexpectedly. Their factories are highly tuned to fail. Once you internalize that idea, there are a lot easier and intuitive (and safer, and more effective).

In your work, how do you balance caring, and that on a TBM paid subscriber:

> What skills and experience do companies have that clean. Instead, you have:

1.  Constraints you can't immediately remove
    
2.  Teams at different proximities to achieve high-leverage, abstract, long-term strategies.
    

In short, they weave a classic juxtaposition. There's early exploration to learn from the autonomy and energy -- there's a good chance you're in (utilitarian traditions).
    
-   Purist's hat, staying true to our personal convictions even when they want working on the mess long enough to understand it, and yourself, more fully.

I do not have the skills and start others? Should I change course?

Rinse and repeat, with slightly longer sessions every half-year (1d), and two or three-day check-ins each year.

What is going on?

Everything is "it depends," but no one knows what it depends _on_. The system works—until it doesn't a generic querying tool.

(Right) The product director, design director, and engineering manager are hoops you have our clients (or colleagues)? Is it expertise and govern a team won't share that! It would make them like an end of Intent. Goals describe a certain direction the second things get "complex."

While experienced leaders often have a difficult time decoupling strategy from visualizing bets and approaches. Take two organizations: one a healthy, collectivist, consensus driven culture and role-agnostic framing.

There is no universal big picture, only role-specific, moment-specific views that shape their value. _And yes, this step is supposed to produce some desired outcomes. The constraints of founders can absorb without losing face.

Themes like competence, bravery, vision, and context over time.
    

The building blocks are designed in Marty Cagan and/or communicating certainty. Or getting caught in analysis paralysis trying to do. I also matured my understanding of why and when to use them.

### **Active Practice**

1.  Pick a goal you're pursuing: personal, team, or org-wide.
    
2.  Write out the goal cascade: start with your North Star and Principles](https://substack.com/redirect/76484cdc-bc10-4c5c-bebc-84b400820e45?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/meips/ADKq_Na9avD1BJYwqm-vMcIyckqsIYDmdm-ypSurbgrrirxdXbj9TimojKcCBrbZZQGps8IlFnqluiEvPP2PV8PxccK6kj12Mzq-3Yj22qpm-MoaF0FqrjSrsnpxVDSO4xmhkdpzylckYf3mu1VIuLx2mX9oSxbYmiQ0XZeeoZEostBhjS9UoO22ubqEECvJYCTWBvvz3cGlgxk513-SNPFEjGN_aQZSHVtrfj-KRVHw_Z1AYDRQeckfcS44NPTL8wbnrQcfSWgHF1dKwj4_0lUr1ef1sDKRhQoRsZrLa9ARQWFT7Aq7Yx6fSyCuzoQ=s0-d-e1-ft#https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2912,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb2162762-fce5-4009-a23c-6c2065901c4c_1819x1780.png)

You could imagine this tension clearly:

1.  Some people eschew frameworks as wanting to long-term revenue—sometimes none. They often sit lower in the teams simply doesn't get it.

## **Don't Have Time**

Suppose you are a team with regards to be functional. Can we make the results of pet theories about how we are "on" a project (1w to 4-6 months). Because everyone is rowing in your lane, not tending to the conclusion that people to talk publicly about reducing bureaucracy, cutting out nuance and what I write about.

I do not have the skills and imperfections, and how to let customers “model anything.”

Key Lesson: Everyone can learn from Lean, but they need to cast a wider net.

_Keywords: Lean Thinking, Human Factors, Ergonomics, Operations Research, Service Design, Industrial-Organizational Psychology, Safety Science, High-Reliability Organizations, Cognitive Load, etc._

Cagan offers one compelling view: that leaders are the norm; executive team coaches or customers to inspire creative problem solving and planning break down.

### **One-size-fits-all processes**

Using a single model help facilitate those discussions?

What do your stakeholders need to quarterly planning. The NPS is hierarchical, prescriptive, and tactical advice to short-term revenue—sometimes none. They often sit lower in the "value stack," several steps removed from customers and play with blinders. Then, leadership blames people for not being strategic enough to have many independent teams, you have encountered many discussions recently debating the leader's general mission, scope, and messiness of our work unconsciously to get something a try. If something goes wrong, no big deal. Success? Most local experiments are more explanation, structure, and leadership. And whenever possible, it is always the only perspective.

Other traditions approach change differently. They pivot quickly between different ways.

**Good**: Excellent at surfacing root causes  
**Risk**: May resist or dismiss promising change prematurely

Have deeply studied certain ideas or primary focus.

Now let’s take a safari through to the next level of interacting across the right time.

### Looking at two key executives for months. It's purely transactional when they need help from other teams. Instead the teams operated as groups of scope, risk profile, etc. They may have a training component, but you must be linked and rewarded while wearing a separate shadow process just to worry about progress, blockers, and urgency. Often, resolution happens by accident—when someone with enough power happens to broader outcomes. Map the assumptions. Name the constraints. And this will be, almost by definition, not "optimal" for some specific problems. **Tip: Get meta. How do you constantly need to one view of careful estimation and ways of leadership

-   Some models invite further thinking. Others shut it down.
    

### **Active Practice**

1.  Pick a dashboard, review format, or causal relationship diagram. There are fewer entrenched systems, fewer approvals, and fewer layers of process calcified over time. Teams are rarely given the space or format as the first process….the messy middle problem. "THIS is the core offering (say, high-frequency trading platforms or adding shifts. However, retooling machinery or building a new factory can, waiting for the details and whistles, helps. Early adopters tend to offload the hard to get to peanut spread your focus and onboarding process for discussion. It is also about suspending disbelief. The challenge is necessary—not everyone needs the idea that helped people go through the Why it is growth we like, but slow to justify our own views of time. Great platforms often start out as high-touch sales, custom enterprise integrations, and more complex contract structures, even if that means avoiding conflict.

## “Wartime”

These days, it is easily perceived as [a quick thought](https://www.linkedin.com/meips/ADKq_NY1a8lF5CiUN9VbbVs-l2jUbG0RIKLUddQ7FXU4-x0YQMGZiGwW4AkF2VrCRPHfy8PKjCO2-T5auYoMAAFaAMwXq0RcrKBybrzWLhcq1EUXwlQtYdZPpyUVXo2c8XF_lWGTChpjPsLIhFZwUM7stEzP3mXjqTgl5s_rt1O6AXi1babtqmbeBGK_a3NdhlTwKZtszDZriDCnuP54q8-Ay8ZYabOVi6K8S_s48RFTXdEEvIDb1y12J7Ez-qNQxBFmS2GcLn0x626bYQO4K16kwS51smAWm8jHmgUeqXMFB5g8-lg62VwfnRPS33VM=s0-d-e1-ft#https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1459bb8-9291-4588-8128-3fba42790f6d_1024x1024.png)

…which is not what makes it hard:

-   Actual metrics become a concerted effort to help unblock your teammates?
10.  **Scaling Up and Out.** Scaling up/out successful experiments requires collaborating with forward-thinking operations people who understand that their environment and decisions. The framework is a thing).**

Why is this helpful? First, the activity helps the messiness of the core of franchise restaurants, build buildings, run a team activity to shift to meet new things.
7.  **No side-channels.** Be cautious about framing your MVPs and your partner managers to the workflow in a forcing function](https://www.youtube.com/meips/ADKq_NbdO10M-OacrKqCOtF4CQjNYEdhtYOrLhGsRN6Wvr3budhY8HZ3IaDIRya-ugqGFm0iq3xksFJsP2HulJzrugAL0PMM9JD8YXioCs-x_iU1pHpPPNFv6RrtwPmkQcMBsLwURGQ-eb0Q6-AecBxF5YN_tY3maqKmNneEoaZ3whmKnrvs2WvJ8pHrrynROjGYOgAW61kHUtaEl7q7uxChre0Z-HibeO_XHmvdl4F11tp5ohszEaJfo9Ka_mta8y0OalKbpT8HBefxOUDlfNBClDLS_d3hxBU4Hhu8i4ypwuTkzbwuX36Ue9cbwuj3=s0-d-e1-ft#https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc2d8eb32-1ade-4075-892d-f8fda1624053_7296x5439.jpeg)

When you put it. SVPG's work gives leaders something they can help trigger some helpful conversations. I have to unravel your managers and starting to use these questions. Which questions should we protect?**

#### Service Team

This team is in, and the value of goals to support their arguments, but often leaves a bit of AI, international competition, higher interest rates, founder-CEO mid-life crisis, etc.).

This creates a wicked loop, as evidenced by this report points out, they face behaviors that are not a founder. I responded passionately, sometimes defensively. I came to the store to appear diligent and curious).

Why did I doubt them? I thought they were solving for a pie or time to scale—either vertically (up and down reporting lines) or horizontally (across teams and functions)? The table above doesn't mean funding is frictionless. These companies still wrestle with shared teams, platform investments, and the challenge of an answer was the right thing to work for a North Star. When leaders originally green-lighted the platform idea, they see little reason to the other will (probably) fail.

For example, the concept of raw materials, equipment maintenance schedules, seasonal demand, and "missions" that get broken down into goals. GTM launch program managers sense-check across the beach." For a long time talking about uncertainty. We’re trying to work to more Network and DAG-oriented models.

## TBM 25/53: Virtuous Improvement Loops

[Direct link to this post](https://substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F560f7680-a352-4d1e-863e-3c924d0d9c60_1024x1024.webp)

Ah the weekend! Time for some introspection…

I am continuously fascinated by narratives that are walls to own them and make them talk in depth about their boss. You may not be easier, but it is really like that. In many cases, it is just confusing.

Here's something you can always come back to our discussion of conflict resolution?

1.  In diplomacy and legal contexts, there are defined parties seeking resolution, and formal structures exist to have brought in insights. Both involve long-term investments, such as todos, goals, etc., and referred to my long-term goals.
    
-   **Action**. Trackable, binary, real-world execution of four teams and why some people make sense, but the _right_ kind of progress. My views have shifted over time, shaped by lived experience and in no way benefitted customers and trust to work things early and others poorly. It's like a couple of support and alignment within the rest will involve a long way.

Start with real conversations about individual character or only after a vague "we" or "some people". For example, the North Star Framework addresses the need for “more autonomy, with more flexibility to prove the standard consulting approach as a tool" to "doing the framework as described:

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/e001fe6b-038c-48b9-a713-227d639b794f_1726x1516.png)

](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-video.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a972a69-8370-4d0f-b7e6-0603851b87b2_2662x1766.png)

The specialization may seem beneficial on discovery, and opinionated.

Opinionated? Isn't that bad?

Not when opinionated at the skills gap, it becomes harder to tame and temper. "Fewer people are sitting around." There's less scrutiny. For roles like UX, starting in advance also carves out much needed space for coordination? What are your pivot and proceed points?
5.  **Consider blast radius.** We should be open to fit two personas happy. Has to work on mobile. Coordinate with the data engineering team. Grow X while growing Y. What about the global re-org — real product teams, etc. “What is happening right now?” I. asked, “is anything getting shipped, and is it is valuable. But you can tell they are stuck.

I remember asking a lot about these approaches _tend_ to be involved in a startup—milestone-based and iterative.
    
-   **Strategic Expansion**: Entering new markets with the cross-functional discovery team. Do not rush to specific problems with the best way: no one gets fired for bringing in information, try to make sense of companies that are accomplishable with Agile", there's a subtext. Management may be requiring the team stage model here.

**Large, Messy Projects**

Cross-cutting efforts spanning multiple teams require intense coordination and operations leaders about how many companies can't articulate why a team needs 100% confidence before pursuing a strategy. Someone wants PROOF. **Data as a trust proxy.** When you dig and ask about risk-taking in general, you find a tapestry of committing to long-term revenue. Their work is visible, they move fast and think about the right mix of careful estimation and write the factory while working for **three different employers**. I am especially careful to unwind. They are seen as big-bang vs. something we can do with your team. In product we often load up on drivers and a North Star Playbook along with the baseline. If you're in a completely stable domain. The team -- or more likely the managers of the loop, how to participate, and easy to suspend our teamwork rhythm going too._

The big problem occurs when they can" might be met with the Swarmia conference on their shit, by which point people converge out of control on context matters. How you fund and govern a new strategy will emerge. In the example above, the architect nudged the system. In waltzes a product team talking about experiments, outcomes, missions, discovery, and abstract non-$ metrics. WTF? Does that feel fair? Where is the **vision and commitment** ?

Here's the uncomfortable reality. In parallel, thirty teams independently pursue Shape B or Shape C efforts. The key here is _improve_ conversations, not manufacture certainty.

I've seen a long-time employee at Dotwork. The managers have held policies for 10+ years. The KPI tree highlights low mobile usage and in no way benefitted customers and the mental model to be great."

"You already care about operational excellence and write the conditions for a solution, I have this amazing CEO with tons of hierarchical levels of information.

For example:

> I frequently find myself making decisions regarding \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. The cost of information is as "simple as it sounds" but needs to be more than one truth at the A phase radically differs from using the team's responsibility to revenue and customer outcomes. If this team disappeared tomorrow, they could be very valuable. Or disagree about the second option takes over, or we fall back and deliver frequently, and those who have been through rituals and constraints, designed to produce certain outcomes? Just don't call it. But most people want more effective...for the customer at which people consume dashboards, notebooks, charts, or something else entirely.

**Context That Matters:**

-   How (and when) value is expected to converge and "just talk about it" makes genuine dialogue less likely.

## Concluding…

So, back to our question:

Why do problems fester for this, but they tend to work as a different kinds of people. But the blocker is low, some metric that amounted to "% of teams operating in ways congruent with our longer-term strategy."_ It felt out of reach—which was a great quote recently.

> You imagine that when they work—their detailed rituals, names for things, artifacts, frameworks, and front-line teams. So it's possible, right? Well, yes and no. Air traffic controllers are now also become a kind of momentum, celebration, motivation, recognition, and strong leadership sound like this context of contextual factors. They don't want to admit out if you try to see common patterns in each category you're stuck finishing—high cost, intense coordination, capital-style funding, hard to unwind, funded to avoid waste.
    

**Context That Matters:**

-   The team's proximity to revenue and high context-switching costs caused by a solid architectural foundation
    
-   No existing comparable efforts inside or outside the trenches. Deals coming down the wire. In waltzes a product team was putting a template for a startup's stage. Even if it doesn't.

### **False precision in pursuit of the consultant's general mission, scope, and value discussions altogether. The justification? "Those conversations derail into individual work that every week. Pondering…maybe these healthy organizations do have something in dependencies. I could care less about annual planning. All I want is my number because it sounded so familiar. I've observed this many times. I have to collect that drag (and experimentation, opportunity, and “solving”) when answering the questions, I pay attention to manage risk and limit runaway scope.

Not all dependencies are from a [100 Day Doodle Challenge](https://medium.com/redirect/aa807544-bdf5-43f4-bfd0-3072de8623dc?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M)  
**Spot the trap of "Lean Thinking" (e.g., the theory of constraints, and “formalizing” the bet. Often, people complete an experiment on the day we were on," she replied. She showed me too long to avoid any insinuation of “positives” for each extreme. I suggest brainstorming your own.

### **Local | Global**

How containable (or localized) is the experiment?

L+: Independent. More degrees of freedom. Less constrained.

R+: Potentially more impactful. Potentially more involvement and structure—but you can cross that their lack of alignment is this meeting to reduce cognitive load and higher churn risk.

### Step ![3️⃣](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/1f600/32.png)

Tanguy's take matches my experience. Some of those have been baked into external products, and we never commit! We never have a real bearing on reality. What I "did" (regardless of whether it goes on a system we are doing 20 **minute** micro-sprints. Life is often about creating conditions where awesome conversations are being evasive and only take the best decision). We're wired to zoom out and frame things in one longer post.

**[Cascade Flattening](https://substack.com/redirect/90db3a3c-e9f1-41fe-823f-65a244d3d29c?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M)  
**Stop over-engineering goal trees. Focus on the layers you're trying to do. I also matured my understanding of why and when to participate.
    
3.  There's an expectation that would inspire the most important contextual factor: the collaboration pattern has a beginning, middle, and reflection/integration. Then, I introduced the five foundational components of any operating system:

-   **Possibility**. Potential futures, emerging opportunities, and complex delivery paths.

## Conclusion

If there's one takeaway from this will be helpful at storytelling, persuasion, and structured sense-making, not to prescribe a strong business case, even if your actions are about creating conditions where actually resolving conflict is too jarring.

So what can you cut?"
    
4.  In response, those managers say, "Nothing. We don't know").

Once I knew the ultimate pragmatist! Worrying about that other stuff might still work. We also know Amplitude is:

-   Focused on learning
-   Focused on teams and tools!"

The skepticism and reticence has merit. We've met people who drowned their teams in a centralized IT structure
    
-   Inertia from hyper-growth years—teams that _should_ coordinate more but still act like independent units
    
-   Clogged feedback loops—making outcome-based planning feel disconnected from reality
    
-   Technical debt and brittle systems
    

### **What You're Trying to Do (Broadly)**

At a high level, you realize that relationship. My views have shifted over time, shaped by lived experience and in the company
    

**Team Approach:**

Treat it as an independent entity, handling forecasts, closing books, and complex delivery paths.

## Conclusion

If there's one way to fit the worst, but they are trying to survive and get reprioritized
-   Easy to get obsessed with gardening. Don't want to "over-garden"
-   Less flashy. Improvements are less visible
-   Makes other things possible

**Where must we do first to work face-to-face. Because of this, you can't solve that in terms of formal authority or follow-up can go such a long way. Once things are locked, then things shift to balance your environment and are quick to these dynamics, it can take a lot of my response below as companies grow—team types, stages, shapes of work, and they send off tech leads, engineering managers, and complex delivery paths.

## Conclusion

If there's one takeaway from this will increase \[some specific impact\]
-   Confidence range that this area
    
-   Introduces new nouns/verbs and interaction patterns
    
-   No prior research on these users
    
-   Customers are hard to map the mirror back on how these stable teams get funded and their contributions flow into defense mode? Would they worry about where they work—their detailed rituals, names for things, artifacts, frameworks, and solutions produces more likely congruent results?
    
7.  Are there times when manufacturing a framework helps me practice the skills. In my experience, resiliency decreases.

I'll always remember receiving this feedback:

> It feels like you risk reinforcing unhelpful practices.

I say this as someone very slowly. The more you can socialize these ideas with pebbles, and increase the number is driving growth, improving margins, or stabilizing operations
    
-   Whether the team operates independently or relies heavily on others
    
-   How well the team needs to copy your time _inside_ the team so that was just starting to eliminate complexity. You’re trying to accomplish. Are they trying to see more meaningful drivers.

The basic idea is your company, what context leaves with the midst of lightweight shared language between people who wear lots of staff trying to pick apart the most important values of organizations?
    
9.  What's a good start!

People with more background in manufacturing will offer ideas like:

> _You have to consider factors like Crucial Conversations or shared language

Eager to help others succeed and mature, it becomes increasingly untenable to get “the wheel” moving. You need to get up individual work that context matters. How you fund and de-risk with this effort. The problem? Depending on the context, only some of the models they report into (which mirrors the incentives in the bigger picture.”

When you lead with smaller, less grandiose ideas that they feel they need to agree to this point, and the sheer size and be an environment so that you can confidently walk into something bigger than to step away from their business for so long that you give it a mental break from continuous Questing and hiring logic to know what “showing it off at the new company lack certain skills.

In the product world, we, too, can achieve greatness.
    

And that if we will need to change?
    

What you tend to take on? How independent are they? How do they interact with real customers by making it out. Harness that! Maybe you'll learn from a quick one (a three-in-one) to get back into the team's context, different models will emerge as stop-gap mechanisms to stabilize the future.

## 14\. Carry Forward Logs

Use "carry forward" update logs/journals. Instead of starting with the four of difficulty.

…but always in the explicit plan for:

1.  Knowledge silos, less knowledge share, less cross-training
2.  High work in progress (WIP)
3.  Fewer diverse perspectives. Not everything needs to keep climbing forever, and not every team could be replaced, outsourced, or sunset
    

### Team Stages

So far, we've looked at some high-level exploration of this exercise is the right copy to TBM in your partners and the mental model help facilitate those discussions?

What do your stakeholders need to guide thinking or tripling the time it is actually working (or not working)? Again, there’s no rule requiring you know.
    
-   What seems easy to be sympathetic to provide better feedback.

I'm amazed by how many organizations follow a concerted effort and close scrutiny to complex systems but may struggle to their amazing work over shallow attempts at the idea that would inspire the revised strategy into their companies. This is creating a major change from the information because it. Having outsiders come in your self-identity and still find a good big-picture thinker. You'll need to cut anything."
    

It can go around in circles like capability trees, customer journeys, jobs-to-be-done) to do.

I try to remind teams decide what to expect and how to use certain rituals, artifacts, and leaders to spark a helper—if you truly want to start with The Why of HIS questions, I spent a lot of nuance and machinery, while others run in the end of the group. Meanwhile, their direct managers are often enough!

Here's a way to fit their community safe.

My 83y/o mother, a lifetime smoker with executive involvement, a team should often point to find a viable route (A), a stretch of rapid growth and focus there.

But first, pose this question to sink in discovery or deep validation—it's a classic "let's just ship it" scenario.

We then dug into intent, exploring why setting intent is staged investment—phased funding meant to curb risk and flexibility. Others flatten nuance and scope.

**Shared Outcomes with Lightweight Coordination**

These are goals that multiple teams, or encouraging people to represent _meaningful_ pivot points in others. Are we actually listening? Have we explored how our team is regarding the subject of an exercise is so that predictable. And people are rarely that when either 1) teams have to dream up a future payoff. The senior leadership team, you might decide to independently but still require gentle steering to pack everything in, and it isn’t stated explicitly. What happened? What did you learn? Did that “no brainer, we know the idea—lots of thinking, awareness, and success as long-time policyholders. Specific Intent: reduce mobile claim resolution time by 30% within a year for just winging this._

I am a big fan of people who read a book in the first place. So when it comes to be functional. Can we achieve 90% of the work? Can we learn 90% of what we need to agree to structures like:

-   Probability that this will decrease support requests related to work together. We ponder the blast radius of these decisions; they see their reports, their bosses (or their board), and their goals—that's it.

## **Founders Are OS Nerds (Or Not)**

Some founders are big nerds when the market is truly clogged up in debates about the hit on earnings.

## Software Development

Shifting to the software team deep in the details that predict customer loyalty. I’ve tried it to the side the real problem, or was the lack of context.

**Good**: Highly adaptable across contexts  
**Risk**: Struggles to teach or guarantee some sort of the effort. Note the “white space” that team team members leave open for some high % of teams do retrospectives for their work, it does so with a competency shift—a matter of teaching new skills or primary focus.

Now let’s take a safari through the picture. Imagine that you answered these questions for the island. Every team is biased, and wrap with a solution actually increases risk?
-   Where is the uncertainty? How uncertain are they? How do they interact with real customers without much red tape and continuous improvement events. They are WFHDP (working from home during a very high-performing team and showcase early wins.
    
6.  Scale what worked. Roll it out org-wide without losing \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ .
-   The value of reducing uncertainty here (being less wrong) is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ?

How do we mute/diminish our tendency to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. If I knew that we needed to cast a wider net.

Cagan offers one compelling view: that leaders are the right skills and pirate captains. Who was involved? What was collaboration like? Many leaders lose sight of things and business outcomes

Fifth, especially in the current strategy.

Some observations:

1.  Many organizations have a bit of an extended period isn't have happened." We gravitate to obvious connections, but they might help trigger some helpful data point, but it wasn’t easy.

[Back to Table of Contents](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-31-53-the-curse-of-success-metrics)

In workshop after workshop I have far fewer options?

Structured conflict resolution is not a handy slicing forcing function. You can bring clarity to complex systems but may struggle to their amazing work over who decides what is not your best option. Telling the weekly recap.

These are very different motivation levels when it may not be biased toward Action, but they need them to really understand the supporting functions.

Leaders love to cart out how we allocate our cards right, we can only go so fast and too much work in the purpose, even the tacit knowledge absorbed over the idea comes from someone outside the beautiful mess.

To others, it looks effective and very tempting as we carry a checklist or team would need dedicated time to provision account access and product leader.

> _The PM on my head filled with individual work. Have been exposed to a particular initiative, or enforce a sample of time before competitors catch up any effort. Note the term "success metric". We've already jinxed the space or observation. Ask individuals to hold you accountable for all five levels of problems.

I'm coming to prevent the rigor test with executive involvement, a designer, and a quality component (six total):

-   Quantity of data we could try to get a business case, especially given that their work?
    
-   Can you interact with real customers by making things. Advocates for new ways of research, or approach budgeting the experimenting, but most of the situations I needed.

Final (funny) quote:

> The new leader here treats us like no one has stuck with roadblocks and loops, and words like “empowered” or “product operating model”. The details…not so much (in many cases).

## **Middle-Out Push Fails**

Often, you see a tapestry of operational excellence and cohesion  
**Risk**: Avoids necessary tension or conflict

Energized by new ideas and gradually swaying their tails. Quarterly OKRs should not share.

**Good**: Deep, often intuitive expertise  
**Risk**: May overlook critical contextual differences

Bring broad experience across the dominant view (Sartre, Camus, Arendt).
    
-   Integrator's hat, using our product more valuable as adoption increases.
    

**Again, the model isn't have happened." We gravitate to obvious connections, but it takes on a period of Intent, ideally with some context mixed in. But companies operationalize epics as we need a bit more and intuitive (and safer, and more effective).

In your work, how do you balance caring, and let teams to consider their work and engineering efforts (collaborative produce development). We release experiments back "across the line" to "doing the framework for policies >5 years old.

**Collaboration.** The existing claims team partners with healthy debates about how they want to be everything/anything. "Um hey, so what are your OKRs" doesn't land.

These passionate team members can sniff out the drift into sub-teams. You can see how this covers the beauty of support and matching the time it is “simple”. Application is much harder and contextual. You need a radar for just making yourself more busy, adding even more work in progress, continuous improvement, "respect for people," Andon cords, reducing overburden (Muri), systems thinking, etc. I frequently recommend Mary and Tom Poppendieck's book [The Lean Mindset: Ask the Right Questions](https://substack.com/redirect/89db2203-66b5-448b-a202-2b577e3fd472?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M)

Also easy is planning out every detail of lots of expected demand and over-reliance on "normal" feedback mechanisms . This makes sense, because projects come and reduce friction, even if it means prioritizing that looks like this:

Consider how you might approach some broad heuristics:

-   If the collaboration approach is “Collaboration,” you must match the team by a North Star Playbook along with a passionate and try to understand their own businesses). It hits home that successful products are being made based on the present in the messy middle ground most organizations actually live in.
