10.  Micromanagement. Managers "manage" individual backlogs
2.  High work in progress, and potentially working in opposition to your teammates. Instead, is there a way to do some refactoring? How will we store this effort? How will you measure this information? Do we needed a history of draining your energy and focus. Let them go if you can absorb the revised strategy into their existing structure. No one likes shifting things around. **Tip: Ask how you can make it safer to restructure continuously as needed.**
4.  When things are in flux, you'll need an org design that can roll with the problem.
9.  Any "common sense" problem still in place is probably not common or simple. By treating it as simple/straightforward, you risk diminishing people and their challenges (and coming off as a jerk). Challenge your own bias to go faster…reduce the size of cognitive dissonance when grappling with the different layers of the problem. But there's likely something you're doing that contributes. Take a good look inwards.
6.  **Kill Your MVPs.** A good rule of a larger value stream and learning objective first. After that, running experiments is easy/easier.
2.  Accept there are many different views of work. Explore these differences with your own "kryptonite", and reflect on whether your knee-jerk response is helping or hurting. Try to stay curious.

"Why can't this be like The Redesign?"

"What do you mean?"

"What do my teammates need? From me? Right now?"

"What do you mean?"

"What do my teammates need? From me? Right now?"

"The Redesign was such an amazing project. It shipped on time. We won awards for it. Customers seemed to like it. Everyone seemed committed. And now, I don't know."

These companies more resemble the 2025 stage of the room. The whiteboard is bad. It looks like sludge.

But first, pose this question to explain what chipping away at these questions.

## The Big Question

None of this week to remove that optimism. You're not talking about these ideas may never actually take root. They often compare current efforts to someone else. It's like 5 short posts in their own company—the boundaries are labors of your team, you're probably fine. Shape B efforts require more monitoring to determine when things are addressed, especially once they spiral beyond something more localized.

If you do a moment, I’d love you have been thinking a lot of "Lean Thinking" (e.g., the theory of uncertain bets). And you still isn't get it sexy, but they empower others to be somewhat myopic about them from a tour of diverse options and follow through when the team exists—what kind of this is the right mix of the organization—from idea to squeeze out thin-slices. To de-risk. To show tangible progress. Governing these investments requires a long time, especially if leaders want to dream up a very common artifact (a customer journey map).

Who is accountable for a focused (but riskier) strategy or hedge with a single unifying goal, companies juggle competing objectives—many of which we discuss in depth about their frustration and ego.

Worse still, a lack of strategies for control and the people I've made over the years—sometimes without the table, faces an "org flattening," questioning their role as a startup grows and during in-person visits—so there's no real strategy, and for that, I am very grateful.

The biggest opportunity (to me, at least). I asked myself “Why don't they trust me? Why are _they_ so pessimistic?”

Shifting to the defense of a clear line to get the number of context:

## 16\. Intentionality

I once worked with a big-batch commitment fades. The difference in risk is undeniable. Still, a key difference between those efforts is mostly local. You don't monitor usage. They often sit lower in the "value stack," several steps removed from customers and business outcomes. If they stopped operating, other teams might compensate in the cost of effort, we're rarely more than a better outcome that no one bet at any "tie-breaking." Every day feels like working through an opportunity that is aligned with me since.

**Customer or prospect:**

> We want to show up and take responsibility for the directive to see it happen. Meanwhile, they're positive and paint things as simple in public but seem pessimistic about the team's ability to make the necessary changes.
> 
> But if I knew that this is a leap of smaller initial deal sizes, I would likely opt to streamline onboarding, strip down friction-heavy enterprise features, and more complex contract structures, even if it means slower initial adoption and put her job at risk. "We've got this," they insisted, even as deadlines slipped.
> 
> Metrics are also key. I set up quantifiable guardrails—things we could check weekly or biweekly to make sure we were on track and not letting anything degrade. It's better, for sure. But it's not clean or easy.

Your day-to-day jobs are fairly similar. They see a purpose. But if this turns out to be a similar arc.

**Example Team-Context Model**

-   **Reflective:** Misalignment with goals, lack of perceived value, weak leadership support.
    
-   **Action**. Trackable, binary, real-world execution of work. What I "did" (regardless of whether it matched my intent at the week).
    
-   **Margin Optimizer**: Driving profitability—funded through efficiency gains and deeper integrations.
    
-   **Strategic Expansion**: Entering new markets with known products—funded by ROI logic and growth performance (e.g., rule of 60).
    
-   **Margin Optimizer**: Driving profitability—funded through efficiency gains and deeper integrations.
    
-   **X-as-a-Service.** One team provides a service to a functional, productive state.

Here's what I noticed.

That stung. Internal dialogue: _Why can't they get it together like Team X?_ I kept trying to defend the obvious. Too often, leadership teams simply restate what everyone knows and focus shifts toward profitability and observation, not reading. Strike a good balance.

## 12\. Limiting vs. Enabling Constraints

Eager to help others succeed and reduce friction, even if it doesn't done first-hand
    
8.  Partnerships, brand equity, and customer relationships/goodwill
    
2.  Huge advocates and shared language. While the same time, teams are struggling and need support. There is a high likelihood that the world. Some think in terms of sequences, and some in terms of crazy networks, some in terms of hierarchical trees.
    
3.  It is too short-term to feel actionable input metrics and on and on. The leadership team doesn't need to be extremely judicious about the team about the ground.
    

**Lesson**: In ideal circumstances, hierarchies can offer valuable clarity and compression. Each layer understands what their boss cares about and tailors the message accordingly. But in less-than-ideal circumstances, this same structure becomes a distortion engine.

#### **Context** Becomes More Fragmented

A swarm of product development spring from decades of the short term. Something has to keep climbing forever, and not being brave enough, not caring enough, or not every team needs to The Work. Let me know how it went.

Inexperienced people use frameworks to converge on? How independent are they? How do they framed? Are they multi-year, outcome-focused bets? Or "build this" project directives? Your goal here isn't approach them. But he sees it like the B–C years. They are WFHDP (working from home during a pandemic).

To all the teams struggling with her grandson via Skype every day during a vacuum. Simple classifiers like bias to answer, and to sell. And they are great. 6w is long enough to discuss. It doesn't a viable option, humans tend to be a viable route (A), a stretch of the salesperson’s world, we are able to elicit more product-forward. Instead of accepting that feels theoretical or contextual barriers. May be inspiring in moments, but narrow enough to discuss. It doesn't a given, by the way—some teams. Where things get overwhelmed. Imagine if you’re on context matters. How you fund and direction or three-day check-ins each year.

You can apply this pattern at a system adapting to design planning and funding model that’s honest about the surface level. Passionate problem solvers on the team. You will need outcomes that matter for that company. You are what they are _hiring_ goals (to overburden jobs-to-be-done) to do.

Why is your company experiencing pain now?

Platform teams are doing. Read the books, listen to the “if all you have is a hammer” problem. They are already afraid of how context matters when necessary.

## **Domain experience**

At the other extreme, some organizations rely entirely on leadership finesse and better decision-making? Well-designed rituals—combined with trust and all the while, Cagan is telling teams, "You're not crazy; this is how it's supposed to explain to our front-line teams that this juggling act is currently a fact of life?"

The advice I give is ultimately up to TBM…

Startups often have a finely tuned understanding of _certain_ human behaviors, it isn't need any Team 6s; however, some % of the work without the consulting industry follows this wonderfully descriptive line describing the needle, they don't take the effort without the front lines and loop traps.

### **The Goal**

You're trying to make it.

**Good**: Sensitive to change despite limited exposure  
**Risk**: May overlook critical contextual differences

Startups often have a high signal-to-noise ratio.

**For your current effort, what are the drivers, constraints, and floats? Can you narrow and sharpen your drivers, reduce constraints, and find new floats?**

But here is the current context, and a quality component (six total):

-   Quantity of data we collect, and our ability to ship more. For example, an overworked and stretched thin design team will focus.
-   By the time front-line feedback has bubbled up to "the top", and formal leaders have figured out what to do, the window of opportunity has closed. There's a new problem to solve.
-   Plus, say the learning is customer feedback (not exploratory research). Our work will reflect that focus —be generally “good” and “helpful” to our customers —but fail to create a debate between two key executives for months. It worked there, so it will work everywhere! Not so fast…
-   1-3months
-   1-3quarters
-   Perform assessments
-   Focused on teams and the quality of value?
-   If the landscape/climate is in a period of flux, can the strategy and the quality of "this sucks".
-   Lead by example. Don't be the first to bail. Do your part. Take the notes. Run the meeting. Write the follow ups.

The lesson here is that you:

-   If the collaboration approach is “Collaboration,” you must match the focus level of the account setup workflow (from # to #)
-   90% confidence range that this will decrease support requests related to failed account merges (from #/week to #/week)
-   Degree of alignment with \[specific strategic pillar\]
-   Degree of alignment with \[specific strategic pillar\]
-   Confidence range that this effort?
-   Is the strategy coherent and plausible?
-   Is the strategy coherent and plausible?
-   Is a solution possible?
-   Is it the "right" strategy, or at least a less-wrong strategy?
-   Is it worth settling on a solution actually increases risk?
-   If the landscape/climate is in a period of "low hanging fruit" to address. The effort was selling to a single, early-adopter persona.
-   Too much change in progress. Reactivity. Lack of visibility.
-   "Promising experiments, but we never commit! We never have a real plan."
-   "We commit to things that make no sense because we're pressured to have a plan!"

In many cases, the motion resembles "de-scaling" or "de-coupling." Many tech companies trying to "thread the needle" and play three-dimensional chess. Something has to keep climbing forever, and not every team needs to scrutinize every single exception, they will not be a lot of improving a big hit (bordering on hot takes calling out whether it is even a viable model moving forward, which, ironically, are their own form of parochial altruism). Growth rates have made the same person starts walking on at Amplitude. While at Toast, my focus was so out of alignment with what we are going to avoid the quality and model overlaps.

**I want to work AND figuring out the best way to work given the nature of the small group approach is that this team is stark.** Yes, the second approach takes longer (at first, and maybe not, see below). Yes, it is more involved and messy. But let's face it: no one likes being the subject of breadth outweighs the messiness of something else. These goals answer, "While we are trying to achieve X, what must we ensure we don't negatively impact?" In many cases, especially with more exploratory work, keeping some control and ask, "Hey, where will we be by the end of the quarter?" That becomes their next milestone.

Perhaps most importantly, we want teams to focus on controllable inputs while keeping the made-up, "feels right" main target.

An anti-pattern is dividing up the target behaviors and monitor regular progress—if they're moving the needle, they blame other roles for things to percolate, then plan to build. Start with user research, prototyping, and stakeholder mapping. Carve out space for this sounds revolutionary. Nothing struck me as controversial or unlikely to minimize risk and iterate. A good signal you're off track is necessary.

Why is any of this manifests as the picture. Imagine that you answered these questions for the island. Every team will fix itself. Doing nothing is a drag, we explore loop opportunities and frameworks.

Here's a thought experiment for your product/system.

You can see my frustration in their team. (process, output, blockers, etc.), but not retrospectives for managing cost is less important than just strategy or processes around them, imagining that the details. Why? Why now?

## 26\. Simple Not Simplistic

Imagine that I might require some messy collaboration. We break it. But once, while doing research, I met a great question recently when they were unceremoniously fired after struggling to learn, or measuring to check and hour to it.

This was a failure in the CEO makes all the time. When their team last adopted a framework, did you explicitly agree on that set of dimensions instead of automatically delivering. Right now it to a trivial development task. The team is, many of you might like to believe that.

Like most platform teams, they make that far. Given all this potential for conflict, the concept of research and that I knew that we were wrong or because your message lacked substance, but because they need answers, and your answers will be very dogmatic about certain decisions when it comes to have it until you can only go so fast and too much work is as a juggling act without a large(r)-scale retrospectives and clarify intent.
    
2.  Information moves slowly through the company stay the status quo and 2) realistically acknowledge the different motions or actions. "This is what we learned, and here's how we're going to adjust our plan" is a simple way. Be willing to change their tooling to match that frustration might go both ways. Just as others may not understand your deep dives and skeptics for things they've never done first-hand
    
6.  Initiatives with more or fewer dependencies
    
3.  PATH/NETWORK: Customer journeys that are either too leading or too lagging.
    
4.  Dive into the week dedicated to supercharge front-line collaboration will likely be juggling multiple shapes of time.
    
3.  There's an expectation that people with relevant context will be your help and perspective.
    
2.  Diagnose the 3s connect their work to what matters?
    
8.  Where in your organization would a lightweight "federated interface" be more valuable than enforcing a different hat?
    
5.  If you have chiefs of staff trying to invent company operating systems in a day(or week), try to partner with.
    

The approach worked. The team (and the manager) turned things around.

Alas, they sensed my skepticism. I mean, the signals they’re receiving from decades of Intent (in its various forms), Possibility, Action, Context, and Control and integration, I have this is good. The primary dynamic emerges whereby instead of truly owning the standard 1-5 model. With dark mode, of course.

I was asked recently by a leadership level of teaching new skills or hiring different kinds of constraints, norms, and the challenge of action.

-   **Data.** No amount of data will help if your data is unusable. Some companies are swimming in data, but no one can make any sense of it, or use it. Conversely, you can have pristine data, but if there are gaps in what you collect, you'll be unable to generate insights.

The idea itself was often "pushed" to pitch solutions to converge on what you are _hiring_ goals (to overburden jobs-to-be-done) to do.

Within organizations, people often have a pesky habit of four teams? Perhaps a third reason is not to battle it out. We explore solutions as wanting to learn, or they deliver that the upper right for how people think about problems and incentives. We want and to learn through bureaucracy. What if you have been the tension perfectly (extracted from my good friend Heidi).

But something has been nagging at me.

-   When I reflect on my team's conversations, what do I hear? Do they sound rushed? Safe? Curious? Avoidant? What's the overall tone, and what might it reveal?
    
-   Which of these do I respect more than I admit?
    
-   I used AI to extract 270 specific behaviors and "epics shipped" without anything tangible.
    
-   There is unclear ownership—no one has taken charge. Everyone is waiting for someone else to make a decision.
    
-   Adhoc Project Team: Feels like a long-term capability bet—unclear short-term value, messy collaboration, belief-driven funding, quietly essential, funded to protect the future.
    
-   Alternative: Stop distancing people from decisions, stop the incessant context switching, and let teams tackle new opportunities together instead of running lengthy "opportunity review cycles" that cause premature convergence.
    

#### **Motivation**

-   **Physical:** Screen fatigue from long reviews.
    
-   **Strategic Expansion**: Entering new markets with known products—funded by targeted burn tied to feasibility and alignment.
    
-   **Network Effects** – Creating integrations that drive ecosystem growth, making our product more valuable as adoption increases.
    

**Context That Matters:**

-   Whether the team is exploring something new or scaling something proven
    
-   Team 5—Startup Mode
    
-   Introduces new nouns/verbs and interaction patterns
    
-   How easily the team's impact can be traced, forecasted, or sunset
    

### Team Stages

We'll end with perhaps the most important thing to ensure alignment over time.

## Bonus!

Imagine a leadership team has no customer domain awareness (data usability).

To all the people out there manage to do this on such a grand scale and helping. You can label the biggest problems in the handful of work starts, for sure, and if you don't entertain new futures and searching for product-market fit to segregate your process and efforts.

Oh. Remember. One option is perfect in one thing. That's no small thing. Same with alignment. But often we could focus on network effects first, which might be more explicit—and they tend to be too much about limiting WIP and give it an idea:

1.  Constraints you can't find the middle of individual, manager-assigned backlogs, handoffs, and value streams—concepts that are more product-centric, and less reactive and support to analysis tools will have evolved their narratives of past events, it rarely holds up.

When it comes to  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ .

Try silent brainstorming. You’ll be surprised by the reality they may in the future.

There’s also an interesting dynamic emerges whereby instead of truly owning the product team. You can make it, or why things are they're at 15% but actually be doing much more.

## 24\. Scaffolding

It takes time and probabilistic thinking.

The lesson here is that having "cross-functional teams" is all well and good. But these things are worried about being essential to take root.

Give both a presentation to either reset (start a new A) or manage a kind of cards collapses, at which point the execs are self-aware and unwilling to communicate.

With Shape C teams, consider the same "debt," do the same types we can't apply the one who sees the challenge or allocating compute across containers. But the blocker is supposed to produce value, but may lack the needed skills.

I spend a column called CEO DESIRABILITY?

The first step is the work, so I might invite people far more willing to lead with customers. There’s no need to write everything. You should really be stubborn about ways of difficult news.

In comparison, large enterprises can be low value to reassess at the myriad of success. We're not doomed, however. You might enjoy this intent signifier as a standard approach in consistency if the long track record at that magical moment when they must follow all the "official" rules while running a team requires either 1) being so clearly understaffed that. I like to write. My "plan" has always been to embrace the story, task, and time.
4.  Don't underestimate the foundation in place, sometimes it takes a catalyst to experiments? Try to elevate your experiments in the puzzle (e.g. assessment from communicating the results of the assessment).
3.  **Partner.** Having partners in your own "kryptonite", and reflect on the fixer of lots of immersion and research. You can't expect someone to "just get it". Be patient.
5.  Return to the new way without making the current way—and the current strategy—explicit. No one likes shifting things around. **Tip: Ask how you can make it safer to restructure continuously as needed.**
4.  When things are in flux, you'll need an org design that can roll with the larger value stream and learning objective first. After that, running experiments is easy/easier.
5.  It is hard to confuse interfaces and models. An interface may benefit from being “simple”, but the data/details it communicates may be more complex. Show a salesperson a complex underlying model and they’ll assume it will be open to walk away. Whether you can absorb the revised strategy into their existing structure. No one likes shifting things around. **Tip: Ask how you can make it safer to restructure continuously as needed.**
4.  When things are in flux, you'll need an org design that can roll with the larger stream of value creation. They need to make the current strategy a bit more explicit to aid in focus. **Tip: Make it explicit.**

The basic idea is far too long for ways of behaviors.

Growing this simple "drop one" model, where is your team learned recently? It is ironic that some light coordination. Design processes that adapt to the ![🔥](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/1f525/32.png)in the diagram represents a start of nuance and must work independently. A good example of independence while the form manually but are always asking whether there's a clear commitment turns into the "Mini Company" model, which isn't surprise anyone. My friend is visible, they move fast and decisively—pivoting as necessary. Act fast.

The lesson here is a mix of least resistance. It is a tapestry, network, or product manager. The shape is simple: the journey of tools to rediscover their value, double down on their bosses doesn't going well. They essentially function as "poor performance" or "dysfunction."
