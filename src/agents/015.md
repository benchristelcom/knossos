# [BASELESS](http://dhigginbotham.github.io/baseless)
[BASELESS](https://github.com/dhigginbotham/baseless) (`"bs"` for short) is a small (`~23k`) modular ui framework for any modern website. The idea behind bs was to create a living styleguide for your website, with pre assembled common use components. You'll find a lot of familiarity between this framework and 
rg "search_term"                # Search in all files
2. Rate limiting and caching
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
import { prepareWasmForEmbedding } from "jsr:@charlesw/taglib-wasm";

// Actions can call external APIs (queries/mutations cannot)
const taglib = await initializeForDenoCompile();
```

### Runtime Detection (WASI vs Emscripten)

1. **Simple Price Lookups**: "What's the current BTC price?"
   - Use: Direct API call (0ms, free)
   - Request payment for as.exe on Windows

✅ **Core System**: Fully functional
✅ **Transaction Hashes**: Link to Arc testnet explorer
The `form-contact` component **already handles** default country selection automatically - no manual intervention needed:

```typescript
2. **Research for Task** → `archon:search_code_examples(query="[specific feature] implementation", match_count=2)
```

**Preview Deployment Notes:**

- Existing files in deployment are **NOT deleted**
- Verified connection (block height: 9624578, gas price: 165 Gwei)
- Ordering dependencies (skill A must precede skill B)
- ❌ Volume is <10 intents/day
- ⚠️ Examples that don't require RMT5 hardware will run.

### Environment Pattern

| Workflows Automated | Monthly Savings | Annual Savings |
|---------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Top 3 (easiest)     | $6,200         | $74,400        |
| Top 6               | $11,200        | $134,400       |
| Total Discs    | TPOS        | DISCTOTAL         | disk       |
| All 12              | $21,600        | $259,200       |

Most small businesses start with the platform and PR:

- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing, linting, and building on every PR
- **Backend Engineer** (1): Tool integration and notebooks
gt hooks repair
```

### Using Enums in Components
```javascript
// Queries: Only database reads
