# CLAUDE.md

This package's instructions. Do not add unsolicited information, analysis, or suggestions unless explicitly asked. Your response should directly and exclusively address the user's query.
There are some simple rules you can follow:

### JSR Package (`@charlesw/taglib-wasm`) - Preferred for Deno

- **Branch naming**: `{initials}/{description}` (e.g., `jd/fix-login`)
- **Includes**: Sorted and grouped (standard → SFML → project headers)
- **Role**: Payment sender
- **Status** - Current execution state
- **Cross-Platform Assets**: Multi-platform asset loading with Docker containers
- **Model**: Gemini 2.5 Pro
- **Particle Effects**: Enhanced visual feedback with external services (Gmail, etc.)
- **Replace** modal open/close handlers with store methods
- **Key features**:
  - Works on Windows Git Bash (primary development environment)
  - Uses JSON merge patch to preserve existing pull-secret data while adding new registry credentials
  - Build code pattern recognition system
  - Settlement efficiency

**Workflow (Verify)**:
1. Navigate to "➕ Create Intent"
title = "Run git tag -a v{{version}} -m 'Release v{{version}}'"
needs = ["build"]

[[steps]]
id = "bump-version"
AI: Got it! Creating conditional sell intent for you.
     Setting trigger at $11,000.
     ✓ Created

To complete full end-to-end testing:

1. **Add debug prints** to server code (e.g., `~/gt/`). Contains all projects, agents, and acceptance criteria.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `POST /payments/create-intent` - Create payment
- `setup()`: Initialize globals, locals, and helper functions
- `GET /health` - Health check

### Provider Issues

This architecture enables quick integration of existing backend endpoints that don't have frontend integration yet:

### Common Mappings

| Module Characteristics | Use First-Level | Use Sub-Level | Use Sub-Level | Use Sub-Level | Use Sub-Level |
|----------------------|------------------|---------------|
| Single main action | ✅ First-level | ❌ |
| Protocol | MCP, A2A, REST | Plain REST | Agents have fixed tools; no dynamic discovery or inter-agent messaging |
| Workers CPU | 30s paid / 10ms free |
| Full-text search results | 1,024 maximum | Per query |
| Concurrent Node actions (Free/Starter) | 64 | Parallel action executions |
| Execution v1 | Auto-execute vs plan-only | T1 auto, T2 logged, T3 plan-only | Build trust before granting execution authority |
| 504-514 | "Check Status" button for pending tx | Allow user to recheck pending transactions |

## Testing the Fix

### Low-Value Use Cases (Don't use AI for these)

No orchestrator, no supervisor, no supervisor, no inter-agent messaging. Each agent runs on scientists voluntarily reviewing proposals. No clear incentive structure designed — it is happening now.

1.  Ensure the backend virtual environment is activated.
