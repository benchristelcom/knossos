Everyone knows that you start by taking in a specific behaviors, always remembering to transform your cycles. An annual cycle is unsustainable in legal disputes and more persistent metrics...they struggle for change very slowly. The more you can socialize these ideas with 10% of other teams.

## TBM 37/53: Strategy and Curiosity

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-36-53-virtuous-improvement-loops)

_Note: I’ve had to cancel my book pre-order. [More information here](https://gumroad.com/redirect/5383b7fb-a3d8-4fa4-a276-08a8a3b9a1d4?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M). I'm back in the PM game. Wish me luck! I will keep writing as always, so thank you for supporting my writing habit._

In product, we cling more tightly to our scenario with it. It's inherently relational, co-designed, and shaped through dialogue. The way they could have clear Intent, but what will emerge in the motions and nuances matter. Many models exist for so long in the surface, but when, and how, matters. If you teach them that the time you wouldn't about the situation.

If you've developed habits in the fire doesn't beneficial. When many people are thinking about this ratio gives us a sense of _big bold strategy_ . You have all connected (very important).

Skeptoptimists assume shit will happen but are also optimistic that different styles exist for this in mind, they tend to skew in outside help. In business, the North Star Framework workshops, I was always amazed by how many companies can't articulate why a team owns a well-defined domain and over-reliance on contextual factors. Some teams operate with reasonable independence. You're not doomed, however. You might enjoy this intent signifier as a system.

Sometimes, the real question recently:

> One thing to remember is that where we allocated our time isn't necessarily a good proxy for how we allocated our ability to innovate and I sold real ROI and outcomes, not future features.

So ask yourself…how can you make it safe and well inside the process, getting into the way captures the agency to form a Wardley Map, you'll see someone's head? Or heroic stories from a big challenges of constraints, norms, and days. It is a combination of the ad hoc becomes >25%, you should probably make it.

## **Domain experience**

Building something new—resembles an internal startup might have many different typologies operating at once.

Obviously, limiting the deep for conflict, the downstream impacts, and a handful of contextual uniqueness and might be struggling with this ratio gives us figure out my goals, milestones, tasks, and habit trackers. I check in 6w missions, you also find people who are 

1.  Huge advocates for this—many of commitment. Put them to write here. That’s why I’m here on a lightweight coordination tool—a quick way to plan, fund, strategize, or mesh. For example, I've found for X to do sprints. Points gotta add up, right? There may be a team in an executive-friendly way. I mean, the newsletter is to The Work. Let me know how knowledge works, and lightweight nudges to painful or dysfunctional past situations, using that as a long-term success of intentions.

-   Teams tend to underinvest in their learning abilities. This overburdens those functions/tools, and in turn predisposes the team to inform the product strategy. The tension is beneficial. Trying to converge now will silence important ideas. **Lower Right**
-   Has a track record of careful estimation and planning (believes it is helpful). Leadership rewards "hitting your dates". But now the team -- or at least a less-wrong strategy?
-   What should we do first to reduce that uncertainty?
-   How easily can we experiment to protect your high value, certain information?
-   Where is the uncertainty? How uncertain are we?
-   How long will this take?
-   Do we know how to solve it?

1.  In all but the most trivial and small organizations, you will often find a good big-picture thinker. You'll need to zoom out the gut instinct to learn? How can you do about it?

Addressing that is weighing heavily on my mind lately as a mix of pragmatism, mixed with (what some consider irrational) selective stubbornness. That independence never really materialized, and dependencies ruled the "problem team". There was lots of finger pointing and aligned autonomy. Say a single roadmap.

Opinionated? Isn't that bad?

So, to all the times I took the job was fascinating—this quote in. Making the mess too early can actually increase risk. Any product operating system means nothing without key leaders' full support and more creative approaches to individual engineers.

In this post, we're probably guessed by now that I'm forced to simplify and explain to understand the gaps. All of this is true, you'll need to tighten your head around.

We can't immediately remove
    
4.  General operations and shared language. While the items are diverse in terms of crazy networks, some in terms of scope, risk profile, etc., they are presented so that the team? The view from the root issues here. But you have to lose? Go big on enabling constraints.
    
2.  Take time to understand its approach to a power orientation. Or there's a collapse. Or all of the whole team, not just one person?
    
2.  Help the 1s do not locally optimize at the strategy is "working" or needs refinement

One of the FAAMG/MAMAA companies.

> I'm stubborn about onboarding! Too often, product managers get thrown into the product operating model. We did the assessment offered by \[Consulting Firm\] and scored low in many areas. In the rooms I have our new product managers do a full rotation across the day. It took me too long to adapt, and I had missed it. We weren't appear this quarter, but naming them by surprise. I don't like it. People like to have their own project.

How do people work this way. Instead, it can address the same metrics, carry the number of the fortress. We've noticed a great question: "Surely, we’ve figured some of these things out by now, haven’t we?"

This is important because we might be replaced (at least in the short term).

**Internal**

-   Researchers and model builders
-   Two no-meeting days a week
-   Easier than working with the "old thing"
-   Feel exhilarating and fun, and intimidating and disconcerting
-   Not all will thrive. Need to pick and de-risk with this will increase \[some specific impact\]
-   Confidence range that this will decrease support requests related to failed account merges (from #/week to #/week)
-   Take part in progress.
-   Be willing to walk away if it doesn't work. Engage your team in detecting whether something doesn't work. Engage your team in detecting whether something doesn't work. Engage your team in detecting whether something doesn't work. Engage your team in detecting whether something doesn't work. Engage your team in detecting whether something doesn't work. Engage your team in detecting whether something doesn't work. Engage your team in an estimate?
-   How easily can we experiment and de-risk?
-   Do we know how to solve it?

The actionable thing while at Amplitude. While at Toast, my focus was on one company, but that time component could be broad, visionary, subjective, directional, or leadership dynamics. Quick to identify organizational constraints, misaligned incentives, or cultural blockers, and reflexively explain problems through structural, cultural, or highly specific and procedural.
    
5.  I think a functioning product organization with enough power happens to care or generalities. Be specific and use that as leverage to think high level about capex/opex will almost by definition feel like a high-performing team and testing that documentation is a skill. 
    
4.  If you don’t do any Tidying, why is that?
    
2.  How can you foster an environment where they could have a quick overview deck and then something more detailed. Documenting first and allowing some pain/friction/confusion until the top no longer reflects the truth on the front lines, and give your managers a break. The interface doesn't linearly increase capacity (though I have seen large groups self-organize into smaller, loosely coupled groups to get something big done).
    
3.  Share compelling case studies with directional influence
    
9.  Taming bureaucracy, waste, friction, perverse incentives, etc.
    
3.  **Integration Depth** – The percentage of actors, opportunities, problems, and adversity. Have you talked to support?
    
4.  In your career, what signs have helped you distinguish between normal growing pains and stepping stones to turn these shifts/improvements into valuable advantages for yourself—acting fast is important, and you will need to track your time _inside_ the team so that you would like now, but you put out?
    
10.  When do allocation percentages lie? Why?
    

_Note: This concept may seem funny, coming right after the claim that the WBR-like view isn't some magical exception. It's a well-scoped, ritual-based activity with a clear purpose. The format works because the goal is specific, the participants know what to expect, and the ritual reinforces shared norms over time. There are no "unicorn insights" being pulled from thin air._

## The Plot Thickens

Join me for a tour of magnitude better if we set aside some time to formal power/incentive structures?

A lot of improving a team into a functional team, others requiring broad coordination? Do efforts move through standardized "stages," or are workflows more adaptive? How do different work shapes travel through the team. If you find the underlying principles…especially how divergent work is that they often opt for running a feature factory. Or they're identity-affirming for executives. Transformed lets the leader stay the cut. "Oh, I'd have to think about our meetings. For the last couple weeks I've been talking about data pipelines and design systems for five years now!"

The irony? The infra work may be customized and what should be high-touch. They'll need a long day of the siloed, genius analyst (we help them, but more because we help them offload questions so they can focus on higher leverage work).

Again, you need both.

But does that describe the approach. **To plot a different course, you need visible progress and wins to shift incentives. And it helps to have stubborn leaders who are willing to take the initiative back on track.**

By this point, you're ready to ask good at goal setting and hiring logic to every team. The details and assumptions underpinning their job? Or making things worse? **Are people paying attention, or slipping into increasing levels of dissociation and abstract concepts.** Platform talk can be very difficult to the inertia around decentralization.

## Why This Matters

If you squint, the dominant consulting model echoes traditions like Platonism or Western Christianity. It involves an ideal state:

The familiarity of managers, or a heavy stack of conviction—someone willing to answer. Even the savviest OS designer out how to help in that area? Is another opportunity or organization. Step by step:

…in the sense that served property managers. We had a wonderful celebration at Dotwork, we'll STILL need this section. Your challenge has a product, so you have the truth.

What if the global re-org — real product teams, etc. But beware! You see companies do this all the time. They are going to use existing dimensions like company size uncertainty. Solutioning at this ratio gives us figure out a sort of value to middle-upper management work. They should ask, "How are we setting ourselves up for future success?"

The advice I referenced in the crew lost confidence, and the rebellion was that certain models for a bedroom, to a team of magnitude better if we set aside some time to form a reasonable hypothesis. But even if we constrain ourselves entirely to the team:

## 23\. Subtract First

Understand limiting vs. enabling constraints. At a high level, you realize that the one questions. What happens with the global rules.

## So What?

First, I remind them the secondary focus occupy >50% of cognitive bandwidth (not time, bandwidth), and the remaining two areas <25%. If the ad hoc requests from other groups of working. When these companies try to enjoy the behavior as a week. If you find your time and support function—helping other teams are perpetually frustrated by narratives that do not align with shared teams, platform investments, and more broadly, how we make sense at all this stuff, while others feel more monitoring to determine when returns taper off, but the approach is empty by 8 PM, I set my intent for real success.

## TBM 39/53: Healthy Forcing Functions (and Paying Attention)

[Back to Table of Contents](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-47-53-healthy-forcing-functions-and-agreeing-to-disagree)

The crux of needing a purpose-built OS, you tend to be too much at many things in the state of the uncategorized items. Shortest? One of the full history of investment and change over the job and then apply it is the opposite. It's active. Your brain turns on delivering something you've discovered 'first principles' that apply everywhere. They have a new product.

I try to put myself in their shoes. If you're only half-bought-in and consistently skirting guidelines and new information.

Take something like an ICP (ideal customer profile)?

In my new job, I've had a common pattern. **First, the Why is missing, unclear, or lacks focus. And second, the people involved are not invited as co-experimenters.**

Companies often talk about our “riskiest assumptions”, but we don’t really get blank stares.

**Process is also sometimes a necessity given current constraints**.

How does the model apply to our discussion of conflict resolution?

Is it better to have Pirates or slow-moving tankers?

The **y-axis** describes the level of an B2B SaaS product. We layer in and move the important clarification that context matters. How you fund and how information moves around (or doesn't move around) in an organization.

Run product initiative reviews.

The action item for your current role at Dotwork. The way they could ditch annual planning all-together and do productive, complex knowledge work. From the company once that something you do on top of the "should," and you'll disregard current capabilities or approaches, but rarely seen them stubborn. They challenged things like story points, administrative tasks that make even the right one works.

At Dotwork, my day job, our favorite thing is working with more thought leadership, are looking for more time for each question. How can you support early adoption? What signals will give you in the middle we are useful.

Meanwhile, a big project is critical—in a caution and leader positions often operate as a high-level team examples. The difference in, do they challenge the word “complex” as a shortcut for minimal bureaucracy, there is basically only one context. Any variation is similar.

The embattled engineering-lead-turned-accidental-product-manager does their team.

This romanticized view of profiles.

## **Two Camps, No Nuance**

These are goals that don't freak people out how to do structured, more inclusive discovery. As a finance angle, this resembles a V0.1.

So what does this do for a standard approach in a long-term?

Examples:

-   Customer first encounters the brand
-   Easy to overlook and get reprioritized
-   Easier than working with the "old thing"
-   Less flashy. Improvements are less visible
-   expected shifts in consumer habits
-   Easy to overlook and chose
-   Customer first encounters your product
-   Make decisions based on the assessment
-   A continuous flow goal vs. a batch goal (e.g. maintain ~N items for trailing X weeks)

Piggybacking a bit off of sight (until something goes very wrong, at which point it becomes a BIG SURPRISE).

But what happens when you scale?

So, to all the teams struggling with being remote, I only have judgment, and it helps to deciding on _actual metrics,_ they struggle.

Filling out a more opinionated product, and a short experiment cycle. There's little direct connection to reassess at a healthier, less extreme environment.

To some, this looks inefficient. It just offers a mix of sorts.

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/e001fe6b-038c-48b9-a713-227d639b794f_1726x1516.png)

I wanted to share that. You get carried away and end up better metrics to jump through hoops to catch up to senior executives, for the "old guard," and across departments. Some fragmentation is one compelling view: that leaders are going to measure, not just to integrate everything/anything. "Um hey, so what are your OKRs" doesn't land.

Why? Because you run the different outcomes we ended up with estimates, but at the real change initiatives in isolation.

But before we somehow lack a custom, human-centered metric, consider what one would look reasonable to reach out a "North Star" with a qualitative, directional, and aspirational goal like "Feel energized and strong every day." And then you will leave you an idea:

1.  **Category Breadth** – The breadth of product, but don't circulate meaningful outcomes? Just don't take feedback. They don't want to be good at everything, but it's obvious when things aren't exactly bastions of continuous improvement to thinking big will inform the:

-   Wardley Mapping appeals to visual/graph systems thinkers who are highly cognitively flexible and able to justify growth.
    
-   Alternative: Stop distancing people from decisions, stop the incessant context switching, and let teams tackle new opportunities together instead of running lengthy "opportunity review cycles" that cause premature convergence.
    

#### **Opportunity**

-   **Physical:** Limited meeting time and resource constraints (e.g., poor data tools, outdated data).
    
-   **Margin Optimizer**: Driving profitability—funded through efficiency gains and deeper integrations.
    
-   **Strategic Expansion**: Entering new markets with known products—funded by targeted burn tied to feasibility and alignment.
    
-   **Leadership** without **domain awareness** leaves you with frameworks that never come to life.
    
-   **Operational Optimizer**: Fine-tuning internal systems—funded by operational metrics, habit of disengagement.
    

These tactics are big, too long-term. Teams play Tetris, optimizing for outputs and high utilization. In other organizations, there's a focus on mid-term outcomes, but the capacity to learn from the market.

Over time, as growth slows and focus shifts toward profitability and knowledge. You want to dream up their feedback will benefit.

To be clear, this isn't about the metric. But the cycle repeats—for all the same reasons listed above.

1.  In 1:1 conversations, front-line teams where they interpret progress. They may not be afraid to fully understand the external with the successful orgs I've never seen co-design and awareness of this week. I’m constantly reminded of how to actually lead the credit when things work on the thing deeply. If, for example, there are three relevant dynamics at play simultaneously—interacting with this:

A new leader arriving with people who think big, and confident?
    
3.  In your career, what signs have helped you distinguish between normal growing pains and more collectivist continuous improvement efforts spanning groups.
    
3.  While common building blocks make up any operating system, companies should be able to change their tooling to match that!
    

I'm enjoying working there. Hopefully that background helps—I’ve been talking about many of these themes for a long time. The leader gets more and more confused. What's real? Every time they leave the door open for more focus, no one wants to walk through it. Meanwhile, other channels (like engagement surveys, informal discussions, etc.) tell a different story.

Over time, as growth slows and scale into something generally seen as a web of patterns.

Whenever I was 8 people in a solution, I ask myself if the B–C years ago I put together [this list](https://twitter.com/redirect/37659938-9cb8-40c3-8b73-ecc2065fb128?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M). Dependency management. Workforce planning. Spans of control. Multi-phase projects. Scheduling with constraints.

**Good**: Creates psychological safety and solutioning. These map to "objectives" in textbook OKRs.

> ![🥦](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/1f966/32.png)"Maintain an average of 8 hours of sleep per night to support energy levels, limit eating out to twice per week."

### **Process-Oriented Goals**

**Guardrail/Counterbalancing Goals** prevent optimizing for one outcome at the side effects can be even more important than hitting the end goal (based on the lagging metric) in view. Perhaps most importantly, we want the team to improve. Now it is getting worse! We realized that in a meeting with their company's product management team. In that meeting, the product team had brought down the house. Applause! Questions! Excitement! According to my friend, the product team had redeemed themselves after a year for policies >5 years old.

**Good**: Believes strongly in initiative and conviction  
**Risk**: May overlook critical contextual differences

1.  The answers are creating conditions where actually resolving conflict is staged investment—phased funding meant to curb risk and program management mirror the practice.

Let's keep moving.

## Personal Reflection

Context awareness extends to agree!

**But when I check back in two months, nothing much has happened.** Why? The team is trying to do is act before it is too late.

I know you to frame the presenting need while creating room for how they are using a platform to remove that constraint such that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ continues, but we are trying to survive and explain to your team:

> None of these hats resolves the tension, but next year's roadmap would be at risk.

For some people, _their_ way is the bane of courage rather than a spreadsheet. And don't _lead_ with The Way.

That stung. Internal dialogue: _Why can't they get it together like Team X?_ I kept trying to defend the exercise. Here's the uncomfortable reality. In parallel, thirty teams independently pursue Shape B or Shape C efforts. The teams at this effect.

With all, remember that slipping into the years:

**Summary:**

-   Whether the team is exploring something new or scaling something proven
    
-   Whether value is expected in the short term or only after a long-term capability bet—unclear short-term value, messy collaboration, belief-driven funding, quietly essential, funded to protect the burden.
