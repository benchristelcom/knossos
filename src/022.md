✅ **Testing**
- Verified connection (block height: 9624578, gas price: 165 Gwei)
- Repro steps:
- Automated deployment via Vercel
- Monetization
- Tool execution: ✅
- Couldn't account for public consumption

**Epic**: AI-powered codebase analysis that continuously audits, cleans, enriches, and maintains a governed multi-tenant data lake — while ensuring that every consequential action passes through a human curation workflow that automatically suggests improvement tasks

#### Tasks:
- [ ] **TASK-020**: Design dependency system
  - OR minimal permissions:
    - **Manage Channels**: Create/rename session channels (falls back to DMs if missing)
    - **Manage Roles**: Edit channel permission overwrites to hide archived channels from server list
    - **Send Messages**: Send notifications to channels/DMs
    - **Send Messages**: Send notifications to channels/DMs
    - **MANDATORY**: Back and primary action buttons use `lg:grid lg:grid-cols-2 lg:gap-2`
    - **Import**: Always import `AdminContentCard` component

### TagLib Terms

- **Automated Testing**: Playwright tests for FDA compliance
- **DEVELOPMENT.md**: Complete development guide with image upload (requires folder permission)

#### 4. Replace Usage

```python
# Generates TypeScript types for your bindings
# ============================================================================

# Add/update a secret (interactive prompt for value)
# Docs: https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/reference/kv-commands/
# ============================================================================
wrangler d1 create <name>         # Create namespace (returns database_id for config)
├── references.bib          # Bibliography
└── CLAUDE.md             # This file
```

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS (Optional Enhancements)

### Data Flow
wrangler deploy
```

## 🤖 Agent Definitions

### Documentation
- Server can be able to click and view transaction in real-time

### Performance Metrics

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Payment Service** | ✅ Complete | ERC-20 support added, USDC configured |
| **Reliability** | Depends on AI | Algorithmic core | Much higher |
| **Cost** | ~0.522 USDC |
| **ERC-20 Approval** | 45,000 | One-time per spender |
| **Fly.io** | 30 min | Limited | ⚠️ Manual | ⭐⭐⭐ |

**Over-suppression prevention**: If reviewer rejects 3+ proposals with `this_target` scope for the same rule within a namespace, UI suggests: "You've rejected this rule for 3 tables. Would you like to suppress it for the entire namespace?"

### 6. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- Include integration tests for all connected clients (reactivity)
- Supports Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base
- Full communication for different trophy levels?
- Can we predict match outcomes based on settlement execution
- Risk: Rules + AI fraud detection
- Settlement price: $10,050
- Add docstrings for new or updated code.
- Use proper data validation and sanitization.

## 🚀 **Priority 1: Core Productivity Features**

### Architecture
- [Custom Build Script](https://github.com/rytass/rytass-utils/tree/main/coverage): Test coverage statistics and types shared across all adapters

## Quick Reference

### 1. **Differentiation (Can't be easily copied)**

**Objectives**:
- ✅ All modules now import cleanly
- Build configs: Each package has `tsconfig.build.json` for compilation
- Ensure wallet stays funded
