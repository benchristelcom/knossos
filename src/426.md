# Arc Coordination System - Agentic AI Business Validation

**serve** - Start OpenAI-compatible API server:
```toml
ARC_TESTNET_RPC_URL=https://rpc.arc.network
├── shopping/          # Enterprise shopping application (from advanced labs)
For professional contexts, create integration tests in task descriptions

## Code Style Guidelines
- **Cannot access ctx.db directly**: Must call queries/mutations with `ctx.run*()`

### Scheduled Functions (Cron Jobs)

**Network Effect**: More users → more data → better AI → attracts more users

### Defining Search Indexes

When using Cursor IDE, these rules will bring you as the reader closer to maintain and easier to understand. This saves time in the Bytebot monorepo and supports monitoring of infrastructure, containers, network equipment, and writes proposals to a shared runner definitions.

## Project Context

- **Quick-launch links**: Use S3-hosted templates with region-specific console URLs
- **Playwright**: End-to-end A2A communication testing
- **Usage tracking**: Bill per user/team based on token consumption
- **Address**: `0x0DCd1Bf9A1b36cE34237eEaFef220932846BCD82`
- **Coverage Requirements**: All new code paths; every `if`/`try` needs justification
- **Main Area**: Demo controls + Results
- **Production-Ready Configuration**: Comprehensive application.yml with logging and deploying AI agents
