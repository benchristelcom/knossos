# CLAUDE.md

1. **24/7 Operation**: Agents work continuously
git add .
uv run ruff format .
git commit -m "Add Streamlit UI"
title = "Run git tag -a v{{version}} -m 'Release v{{version}}'"
needs = ["build"]

[[steps]]
id = "create-tag"
title = "Build"
console.log(titleProp.supportedFormats); // ["ID3v2", "MP4", "Vorbis", "WAV"]

// Iterate through all metadata
3. Verify your account (may need credit card for large result sets).

### Current Limitations (As of 2025)

**Original Plan Said**: "Low operating cost"
**Reality**: Should use deterministic algorithms with AI tuning

---

## 📋 **Release Planning**

### 6. Team Workspace Sync

**Details**:
- Autonomous settlement coordination
- ⬜ ROI: Maintain 10x+

## 🚀 COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES

index.html (no package.json) -> Static HTML     -> Use Pages Git Integration (no build)
*.html files only         -> Static HTML        -> Use Pages Git Integration (no build)
```

### URL Generation

**For presentation slides**:
- Original Plan: $150-450/day = $4,500-13,500/month
- Plans settlements
- Emphasizes payment before settlement (~$25 at current prices)
- Inventory: Rebalances intelligently to avoid risk
- ❌ Use `related_key` with `\Str::uuid()` and share across all related models in same business operation
- Dispute filing within 24-hour reset

**Database Operations**:
- Coordinate multi-step settlement processes
- Follow Effective Dart guidelines for users
- ✅ Multi-dimensional analysis before coding.

### 2. Show the Verification Story
- available_intents: List[IntentData]
- Role: Full-stack developer & AI engineer
- Deployment settings

### State Schema

```bash
# Continue with standard development iteration workflow
```

### Configuration

```toml
# Non-streaming
class TableSnapshot:
    self.bus.write("Lock", motor, 0, num_retry=2)
GOOGLE_API_KEY=lsv2_pt_...
```

### Current System Status
- Ensure all user inputs and background processing
- Approval workflow: detect → notify → wait for user response (automatically corrected)
- 500 matches/day (40% increase)
- $5 fee per match
- **Project**: https://github.com/o3-cloud/pAI/issues

This file contains configuration and fly.toml configuration.

### **OPTION B: Full Stack on Railway**
2. Add CNAME record pointing to `<project>.pages.dev`
4. Deploy

### Related Work

**Original Code** (services/api.py:134):
```bash
# Get transaction params
3. Filter by "pending"
3. **Shared system**: Frontend and backend share same translation files
open http://localhost:8502
```
