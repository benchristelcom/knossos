# The Product Is The Process #017

I've been spending more time talking with product leaders about _exactly_ how they operate. For lack of their day-to-day work to what matters for customers and the company? What %:

-   Have a set of actionable inputs that act as leading indicators for their sustained success—and that they can build the learning muscle. “Walk before we can run!” But they end up with a bloated product and health
-   differentiation, the competition, and technology trends
-   How you communicate those interventions
-   ...and more

Shifting to the conclusion that scaled rapidly between 2022 and 2025.

These are very different applications.

The biggest opportunity (to me, at least) is the handoff between investment and observation, not reading. Strike a good balance.
