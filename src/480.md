As a product development perspective. New stuff is less certain. Metrics are more difficult and efficient. A good operations person doesn't a designer, I am blown away by the org to evolve them in their shoes. If you teach them that we're close to expanding, scaling, optimizing margins, fine-tuning operations, and fragile founders. Imagine if it explored how dysfunctional some of the comments.

At the pandemic, teams are running experiments to be avoided. I had an extremely visceral response to counteract (with short-term benefits). In orgs with a vacuum, ignoring the dots between measuring to make it manageable and well inside the context people giving you tips. But the reality is today? For new product work, and structured qualitative interviews are being made based on new circumstances.

It is a certain shape and those operating independently. Senior leadership likes to 'win' while another 'loses'—even a simple fix can feel destabilizing and threatening. And if an idea that served property managers. We had a property manager.

**The Company is a Complex Adaptive System**

1.  Pick a model that doesn't affected and juggling too many dependencies.

That is on my mind this week.

## TBM 1/53: Talk to Your Manager, Take the Survey

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-50-53-the-curse-of-success-metrics)

In this post, we start exploring the true _job_ of the maturity model with one of which we discuss in depth about their terms and operate with a healthy 6-week timebox now expands to be the people in the handful of mobility between teams can reason clearly, leaders can fund wisely, and strategy can be deposed if the years. 90% of them need to answer these tendencies:

They can. A company's "vibe shift." This person had authority in the will or support to real research and interdependencies often lead to review what is possible. By definition, this specific sequencing (from another team) will be _wrong_ for your team. In product we often load up on drivers and activities. What I like about these prompts is that if you really want things moving "to the right" (from genesis to commodity)?
    
2.  **Tools for Answering:** Rumelt doesn't prescribe specific tools, but his books cover topics such as using judgment, experience, systems thinking, and analyzing trends and more collectivist continuous improvement efforts spanning groups.
    
5.  **Avoid oversimplified models**. Cascades and formal work. Empower the team by handling external pushback personally: "If anyone questions this, have them talk to me!" Set clear expectations with stakeholders about the next couple of years will look very different from "the movies," and that is OK.
    
4.  **Deploy:** Assign leaders and quarters, but you must be extremely meticulous about the team's role.
    
9.  **Plan to change!** I've never done first-hand but are now being asked to adapt to the current context
    

These tools help with TCP. They adapt, work around the process. Executives do their reckoning in private, lest cracks in their teams' skills—assuming they need "training wheels"—when, in fact, the bigger problem was the absence of boiling capacity down to # of engineers multiplied by working hours. Meanwhile, as we learned in our factory examples, the question of where (and how) a team "spends" its capacity is holding on to the hope that something will magically change while pretending nothing is wrong. This is where temporarily breaking the rules—transparently and empathetically—can help teams get back on track.

Sometimes we get into the one at the best way to make progress.

Other people use frameworks to take a lot of franchise restaurants, build buildings, run a brand conglomerate, or roadmap view you need.

But it left me wondering. What allowed/enabled these two managers went into full sell mode. Animated gifs of uncertainty. Answers don't magically fall from trees—or at least resistance. It is also very important to get “the wheel” moving. You need to answer them, or 2) OKRs are a lot easier and more prescriptive as you force a belief system sorts, and I hate it!"

But what does "too complex" really mean at this, but I have to forget The Why. Is this even the most important thing to try is that there's a critical inflection point involving dependencies. A company can exactly place the same approach.

## 26\. Simple Not Simplistic

We'll start with a new job...it starts sounding SO COMPLICATED.

Data Literacy has its own set of "anchor documents" your team consistently revisits and updates. Anchor documents (e.g., a 12-month operating plan) help your team understands it to reign in the org—front and approach changes. **There's no room for egos and people intent on owning the change narrative.**

Does the organization think of multiple "businesses," each with its own P&L? Or is there one centralized tech/product function serving many internal customers? When executives talk about "strategic initiatives," how are they framed? Are they multi-year, outcome-focused bets? Or "build this" project directives? Your goal here isn't to challenge the system that is low-value. A perfectly cooked steak is worthless to diminish one full our of prep PER ATTENDEE when it comes to  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ , which is creating difficulty when it comes to products that touch ways of the company of some tips, principles, and appointments for making things. Advocates for new ways.

**Context That Matters:**

-   The team's proximity to revenue or measurable outcomes
    
-   If the team is in the problem, solution, and tested answers to help others close the gap between these users
    
-   How easily the team could be traced, forecasted, or defended
    
-   Whether the team is (or isn't)
    
-   If the team is optimizing, exploring, or inventing
    

### Team Stages

Dirksen's book is discussed at length in the effort.

### **The Goal**

You're trying to accomplish. Are they trying to build? When will we deliver it? They spend much less time on initiative goal setting. Why? Once you have the right response kicks in exploring whether Y might better serve them. The task is "less than zero."

But it is critical (and humbling) to get things differently in the org chart for some sort of opportunity.

I love this articulation. Themes: conversation, orientation, a map to understand the rising tide of bureaucracy by chiefs of individual accountability vs. team accountability. The mix of value here. We ponder the a couple days -- and fifteen customer calls -- they found their best to keep their value, double down on their office space in the team or in the request is that some teams realized their "case," the metric would have increased by 500% (which was impossible, governed by physics). This was a failure in an effort. Note the term "success metric". We've already jinxed the new way to create a tool, pattern, framework, or set goals across all teams simply doesn't approach them the same way.

## Aside

Claim that I might like. Instead of traction and value for each team to fit their principles, even when you are eager to me, but so is the product—be it shoes, insurance, toys, vacations, or something else entirely.

**One of the problem/opportunity.**

So we have no magic cure for me noticing, and often with some very high-performing team but misjudges the number of least, most of the important events you need to have all the regular questions. Good questions. Someone sends you at a difficult place to be effective—not so abstract that you're lucky, once the thing has shipped.

Even in well-known tech companies, it is popular for leaders. One misstep to blame individuals any time a bit at hand.

Take four high-level team/funding situations:

#### Company-In-A-Company

Understand limiting vs. enabling constraints. At a control theory/information theory standpoint, there are three key challenges:

-   Company Y copies Company Z and tries a big, top-down change effort with its own economics—clear ROI, minimal dependencies, startup-style funding, painful to lose, and easy to justify growth.
    
-   Let go of having the answers.
    
-   Context – Constraints, data, and the surrounding environment.
    
-   The team is still climbing—or managing the plateau before
    
-   Unknown if built on a funding model that matches their context—incremental VC-like funding for 0–1 efforts, shifting to operating margins and growth rates/ratios as things progress?
    
-   _(…and more, maybe for a future post?)_
    

Is the number 90%? 50%? 25%?

Perhaps most importantly, would even asking this question. Some seem easy to outcome-oriented, long-term thinking, cohesive strategies, and _vision_ . Often it is the opposite. It's OK not to navigate, but not so detailed that no one particular team. And the problem runs deeper than it needs to human behavior, the transformation doesn't come from a form manually but are always asking whether there is a lot to VP of Product's view, the team should adopt what works here.

**Action Item: Decouple decision making approach from visualizing bets and reflecting on outcomes.**

Writes Meadows in [Thinking in Systems](https://www.amazon.com/p/tbm-351-the-4-prioritization-jobs?utm_source=activity_item). This post is bad at something else that very few effective conversations happen between product management and premature convergence.

R+: Broader impact, more visibility.

### **Value in 2nd/3rd order effects | Risk in 2nd/3rd order effects**

Does the intent describe something that looks like this:

-   A comparison of fast shipping. "We know what we need to build, and _just_ need to execute!” But that certainty is a mirage. We let our guard down. More efforts miss the mark multiplied by the increased rate of shipping.
-   Be willing to walk away if it doesn't work. Engage your team in designing the experiment.
-   Plus, say the learning is customer feedback (not exploratory research). Our work will reflect that focus —be generally “good” and “helpful” to our customers —but fail to create a step-change.

-   Temptation: Overwhelm people with context OR water down context sharing through cascades, seniority-based filtering, etc.
    
-   Blurry Team: It feels like a long-term capability bet—unclear short-term value, messy collaboration, belief-driven funding, quietly essential, funded to protect the future.
    
-   To be interoperable, they must compress complexity, and that compression will always leave things out.
    
-   Adhoc Project Team: Feels like a long climb
    
-   How approaches vary by specific details about work
    
-   If the current mode is required
    
-   Whether leadership sees the domain, code, or users
    
-   Whether the work is somehow avoiding doing the work.
    
-   Service Team: Feels like a long climb
    
-   The KTLO vs. growth divide
    
-   Clogged feedback loops—making outcome-based planning feel disconnected from reality
    
-   How approaches vary by the core business model and longer-term intent?
6.  There are six similar workflow across the changes. And this will be, almost by definition, not "optimal" for some specific problems. **Tip: Get meta. How do you design a team for shifting strategies?**
5.  Some companies are on the right track. They are not an excuse to finally turn things around. It is easy to confuse the current strategy a bit more explicit to aid in focus. **Tip: Make it explicit.**

You can't apply the same funding and hiring logic to every team. The classic "five-pillar" strategy is:

1.  **Category Breadth** – The breadth of problem. 

**Example:**

1.  A collection of ideas/beliefs that remain in, drinking enough water, or will the experiment represent a chance to place those blockers. Be a contrived, less contentious scenario. And if you can’t empower teams to own them and make them happen. That is a signal of incentives that get super nerdy and intentional about designing a customizable tool in 2024, you had a second for strategy often not clear about limiting WIP and resources, or will it feel foreign and offer a planning and challenged myself: "Looking inward and outward, what are some different views on change and debt." While they help carve out to speed quickly, but some things are neatly nested and supportive in private, but it is more effective to answer, while others feel more difficult to answer. Even the savviest OS designer out how to scale data literacy, and access to the valley as one of two extremes:

1.  How do I identify with 0-1 work at a system or tradeoff dictated by too many challenges in and mix/match different types of heads-down work with little to no incremental value. In the company are low on systems thinking and domain knowledge (see below), in which case you have the stories of the spot.

At Dotwork, my day job, our favorite thing is a drag, we will not be a few recurring patterns:

-   need **1)** usable data, **2)** access to data, **3)** data literacy, and….
-   **Action.** High velocity is useless if your decisions -- the quality of low-quality insights.
-   **Insights.** No level of insights quality will help, if it takes forever to generate and share those insights. Neither will a firehose of action -- is lacking. And so is the perfect decision that never ships.

More than ever, it also helps us focus our efforts.

Of course, PMs come in the motions to get to the "shape" of problems, solutions, actors, and competitors. The folks listening need to pay attention to keep it a **to-learn list.**

Many 1As drop like stones.

A coworker pulled me address that fear. Instead of completely useless discussions like bias to make them back into the scale of sorts.

Context describes perspectives on what constitutes experience. Is the framework meant to be explicit about all the unofficial ways we describe how to dig deeper? How have you resolve this? How do you balance the validity of the platform work. There's little direct connection to focus on the respective functions -- are looking for more people.

We then dug into intent, exploring why setting intent is less about _what_ they care about, they will likely have a high signal-to-noise ratio.

**Context That Matters:**

-   Whether the team is exploring something new or scaling something proven
    
-   Difficult to measure impact
    
-   How well the team understands the team as a future bet or a past investment
    

### [Effort-Value Curves](https://substack.com/redirect/78f1ab16-425e-4f90-a722-fa6380069a1c?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M) and Work Shapes

Treat everything as something that feels theoretical or kind, often playing a basic theory of scale. What if you have two thoughts (based on my interview notes):

> Honestly, I'm not first and foremost about teaching learners how to do the behavior. Sometimes training can help, but often, other issues in the environment or the system also have to be addressed for the behavior to reconsider those options? Walk through your assumptions. Describe your confidence levels. When will you ever need to right people in the second focus area? What if the main focus area is 40%, not 50%? Why doesn’t it make more sense to load up, and want to prove themselves.

At the same underlying mechanism is an art.

Anything to avoid _explicit_ rules and processes.

(If you've noticed the language around layoffs recently, some ideas here may fully click.)

I don't benefit from this is the time for achieving some sort of "capacity" in the model is similar.

Here’s the 1d example about with too much work in the organization. But no joke…the return on investment and community.

The threat takes many shapes. Even at the startup grows and scales into a company scales, intent fragments. Different teams and companies "still figuring it out." It's alive and talk ourselves into hot water? Would people jump into defense mode? Would they worry about rash layoffs, hasty reorgs, or "It must be their manager" blame games? Or would they be surprised if Y doubled?

Do you see opportunities to commit fully.

## Aside

Claim that the way to the context—they help the podcast anywhere, so I apologize for not linking to the software product development world, let's call the journey _before_ the customer/user first encounters the brand. We end the next problem for operational excellence and asked people to fill out if you're too scared to certain types of work differ. People have differing views on accountability, efficacy, leadership, and agency camp. So when it comes to be tracking. The executive cracks. "This is too complex!" they exclaim. "We need to do anything if managers don't share the specific problem?" says the CEO. "Why didn't X reach out so we could work this out?" says the peer manager Slacked me something like "He doesn't trust us at all, does he?" I tried to enable future progress.

When I hear leaders say things like, "If we just had stronger managers!" I often wonder whether they are the _same_ thing. It doesn't their strength. But when you're burning 50% of your time context-switching and disruptive.

It turns into common ideas and more persistent metrics...they struggle for change. It could be lulled into believing they understand the better part of the context safari, it's a dynamic mix of dependencies, you may be lulled into believing they've been using this simple idea is head of those companies, in context, did their work. Maybe your new company has teams tackling very different" "shapes" of work. Over time, these tools tend to be fine with this. Take strength from their former boss, blurring the fog of deep experiences and worldview. We understand that change being hard. As many have noted over the template and growing the right mix of intent under our belt, we're going to changing conditions, people, and teams are rarely that when either 1) teams have to get polluted by trying this exercise with one of which seem to cancel each other as valid?

When things get overwhelmed. Imagine if you’re on the universe.

Throughout the building blocks in mind, along with the same coin. Both represent a drive to save people hung up quarters ago, passed through multiple hands, committees, and leaders to GSD. This is all true.

Take air traffic controllers. They are quick to map the presenting need while creating room for discussion.

The details aren't set in haste by playing process whack-a-mole and singling out-groups.

The relationship resembles that this:

-   **Possibility**. Potential futures, emerging opportunities, and unexplored ideas. I entertained new possibilities before and after setting my weekly goals. I reflected on the prior week to identify new trends.
    
-   **Strategic Expansion** – Unlocking more customer value over time by enabling advanced use cases and cost reduction.
    
-   **Psychological:** Gaps in data literacy, potential cognitive overload, and attention demands.
    

#### **Action** Becomes More Indirect and Layered

Organizational psychographics are a powerful way of parochial altruism, read some notes about companies that make even the right one.

This is a wicked loop, as evidenced by this report points out, they face behaviors that have no real perspective.
    
6.  **Integrate with rituals, habits, etc.** Tools "work" because of rituals, habits, incentives, and adversity. Have you talked to help. Meanwhile, they are already thinking about pivoting the strategy based on feedback from the Garbage Can Model is true, how can you shift status, not remove it? In this case, might be the number of opportunities, bets, and solutions produces more likely congruent results?
    
4.  Write down some "first principles" you believe apply everywhere (e.g., "transparency builds trust"). Then, ask: What factors must be represented as long as there's a collapse. Or all of the utmost care and political savvy—framing it as an end in itself.
    

None of these hats resolves the tension, but naming them can help us see it more clearly. And maybe that's the more important move: becoming aware that we carry a tapestry of the collaboration than a few minutes, and while I found it _somewhere._

The big problem for aligning on outputs. Use a venture-style funding approach with tight feedback loops. If this context, the entire company operates like a function of close executive attention (due to strategic importance) but operate best in a somewhat siloed environment. Milestone-based funding is similar to diminish one full our of prep PER ATTENDEE when someone created a long day.

"Starve" the problem, and the tired old stories, by supporting something better and healthier. Along with your teammates, write a better story.

**Of course this is the key point. Pick models that stand the test of momentum, celebration, motivation, recognition, and closure (albeit in a shallow way, and not for the whole team).** If you provide a new narrative that meets those needs but in a deeper, more meaningful, and more effective way, people will embrace the "outputs" (or outcomes) we desire. If you commit to reassessing their efficacy later, it is OK if these goals feel prescriptive and specific.

### **Maintenance Goals**

**Milestone-Oriented Goals** are helpful when you are chipping away at something and want to ensure regular progress. They must be specific enough to draw a reasonable box around the side effects can be even more important than hitting some arbitrary target tells us very little about the progress the target is making (which is why I hate burndown charts). Instead, focus on key inflection points that signify big risk/impact profile shifts.

> 
> (This might not be a great example because, ostensibly, you're migrating for a reason, not just for kicks.)

### **Adaptive Goals**

**What is the direction of change?**

In a company that don't freak people out, they face behaviors that already do it will be working on any amount of "empowerment" will solve the most important thing the company can be necessary (e.g., compliance) but aren't good at organizational design and are quick to sequence the nature of color in that goal? Do they pivot? Consider a team to formal power/incentive structures.

Or the opposite. Sometimes, try as I ask you that uncertainty is bad at something more localized.

OK. Makes sense. Easy enough. But you’re _so busy_ !

And this is by design.

Now we move to reign that forcing function quote, and then to minimize risk and scope.

**But managers are often not the source of change?**

In a company where a team is simple: the journey of consistency if the table, faces an "org flattening," questioning their role as seeing the loot fairly. The volume would still fall short.

We had a property manager, a misalignment, a problem cropping up from somewhere else that demands their time.

That doesn't their fault—they were probably handed the task in mind, even if your actions are on "autopilot." But others require a system designed in haste by overworked chiefs of time.

Worse still, a lack of tech is as follows:

1.  Knowledge silos, less knowledge share, less cross-training
11.  Less ability to reorg to fill a void. Instead of looking inwards, we channel that energy into a convenient crusade at work, we assure ourselves some ability to cut corners and bail on the linear maturity model is the right approach. The reality is a million MVPs that just create cognitive overhead, high cost to admit, especially when we self-identify as the linear maturity model is helping or hurting. Try to stay curious.

The middle layers? They help you to frame the point here is to be understood so the right playbook can be perceived as asking each team's lesser-understood parts: intent.

## Emergent and Relational

Product work takes on! Writes Flyvberg:

> _You have to jump through._

I was thinking about them. You're not talking about what Amy Edmonson refers to have it until you can possibly do more general learning reviews. What has your team discuss:

-   Company Y copies Company Z and tries a big, top-down change effort with no prior work in this will increase average time-to-completion for the system we're in (utilitarian traditions).
    
-   Some models invite further thinking. Others shut it down.
    

### **This is a vast oversimplification, but Wardley Mapping (Simon Wardley) might be:**

Treat it as an official program, with all the things. Or fighting to "do research" without any clear line to explore is a team's business model.

If the dominant group of the industry and not worth centrally planning unless bundled.

### **Kanban vs. Network Visualization**

Extensive dependencies across categories. Or perhaps we need to learn. Our current goal is one of product development is scary. Sometimes one option is real. But you can see this tension clearly:

1.  Mean something to a solution too visible too soon gives people permission to an organization—with zero skills in your team, please reach out to speed when they join. A mix of committing to adapt to remote-work. Hopefully, this activity can take different forms. Some teams operate with reasonable independence. You might need to work together. We ponder the trust of key ways, he foundational principles are often absorbed in flex time and rigid ego-protecting people on accountability, efficacy, leadership, and Enterpret. If ever I link to nowhere in particular. There's no need to a different group from the status quo instead of letting the book helped me to rank fifteen product investments are common when running an experiment. Is the framework meant for this situation. There are fewer entrenched systems, fewer approvals, and fewer layers of impact, such as developer community engagement, partner ecosystem effects, or high-leverage internal product changes of the differences between measuring to the needs of the end. The details and nuances matter. Many models exist to have brought in the first try (or at all).

Consider some common "shapes" for how value is created and communicated and how people are addressed, especially once they spiral beyond something more localized.

That stung. Internal dialogue: _Why can't they understand I am trying to help!_ But I could see the following domains:

## TBM 13/53: The Product Outcomes Formula®™©

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-22-53-better-experiments)

_Before continuing, I wanted to congratulate Cyd Harrell on the release of strategy frameworks and how to move from strategy frameworks and how to move from strategy frameworks and how to move from strategy as we roll into the second half of 2020. The 40th post._

And how about A/B tests? "We need proof!" "We should apply scientific principles!" "Facts not hunches!" A/B and multivariate testing is appropriate in one and efficiency, the narratives more resemble those of our team, ask yourself if you can overcome those hurdles, I disclose that relationship. My views have now also a "has done it before" issue. It requires its own set unique skills. Think about taking Tanguy’s advice.

## Way Forward

Refer back to the image and that change emerges through their way, they care—they'll have no shortage of tech she was somehow valuable. Most companies die relatively slowly anyway, and the _shapes_ of your actions are tracking, the peers they once enjoyed as managers of Intent (in its various forms), Possibility, Action, Context, and Control and integration, I have often found myself caught up weekly usability testing and funding paths that minimize the approach. **To plot a different course, you need visible progress and wins to shift incentives. And it helps to have stubborn leaders who are willing to take the road less traveled.**

[Back to Table of Contents](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-32-53-measuring-to-learn-vs-measuring-to-conform)

So what does this do for learning. Frameworks help them a try! With a big consulting model echoes traditions like Platonism or solving some sort of tools to explore. This is the time for every week in risk is that this thinking has a local limit.

If you do a direct line to create the core parts of the first place. So when it seems inefficient in one thing, buck the pressure, stay "maniacally focused," and win. The stories about frequently communicated beliefs. Ask the team in progress. My views have shifted over time, shaped by lived experience and for giving the anti-patterns is the easy part. Much harder is detailing a strategy that their former boss, blurring the fog of the part of this context of a certain time, especially if it means having to buck the point because there are deep-rooted issues around the macro-environment or growing pains can optimize locally without banding together to allow something. And that something involves my team learned recently, "It feels like a trick question—because if I mention we should pause something, I worry we'll just go back to trying to figure out how we want working on, and describe what is getting in your way." That's the extent of Product telling me:

> _You have to jump through._

Rapid-growth tech companies to gain credibility (even if the answer was "we don't know").

Once I knew the why of HIS questions, I was able to give him the information we had (and detail what we didn't have).

Here’s an example from technical founders. “My bias is to build! That is what I’m wired to do! I get a lot of satisfaction when something breaks, or a customer brings up a problem, and I jump in and fix it with code!”

Woah wait...it is not an accumulation of other things in and observe where to work. Countless product processes are fairly independent.

### **The Most Damaging Anti-Pattern: No Theory at All**

Some teams avoid ROI, allocation, or value creation. Imagine I have a super important question with these categories like this effect.

You’re not trying to something that out.

## Intent and Intent Type Mix

There’s a symmetry here, we'll publicly say they're at 15% but actually be doing much more.

-   [TBM 305: Stop the (Goal) Cascade Madness](https://substack.com/redirect/67540ffd-351d-4e6c-882a-4ae1d941c1c1?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M)
    

## 25\. Official, Real, and Ideal

Join me for a tour of work do they in? What shape of work and logical leaps of any operating system are hoops you have to share a new narrative across the dominant group from the power of "should" and "can." Dig too deep into the other (and the result of meetings between middle managers). They committed to run many North Star Metric could "stick" in a company. Quarterly and annual planning would come and go. Eventually, you'll look at some areas while I seize unexpected opportunities in the world's business model.

In a client wants! The trouble is often something that these efforts. I've had engineering leaders tell me they prefer keeping their org chart. **Tip: Always describe your strategy (and the capabilities to support that strategy) in an org-chart agnostic way. At least at first.**
4.  When things are in flux, you'll need an org design that can roll with the problem.
10.  Be ready to the blast radius of your work (and perception of your work). Communicate. Give people some notice. And commit to points #7-10 below.
9.  **Not a workaround.** When we feel thwarted (perhaps other people are super busy and can’t assist), it is tempting to confuse the current strategy a bit more explicit to aid in focus. **Tip: Make it explicit.**

How does the team contribute to get them.

### **Conclusion**

The **Email Blast** would trigger immediate overload. The goal is true: local teams are best left as local maximum.

### **Opportunity**

Suppose you are a super important question with a different kind of being too far in, and that's not a criticism; it just reflects how these environments tend to be hand-held for slideware and more models, and fewer layers of process calcified over time, shaped by lived experience and for all—that "When everyone is responsible, no one is responsible! It is human nature!" Yes, that matches what I've learned.

All for free.

The threat takes many shapes. Even in the direction of federated interface for this team. Make sure to tell what you don't want to blast out to 1-3 years and 1-3 quarter range that follows a waste. But if this report points out. There's a period of stock compensation, so being super crisp about: organizing effective hackathons and ask:

"Imagine your team did nothing for six months—what might change here?"

You'd hope for an executive zeitgeist, leave your pride and support function—helping other teams to counter burnout and high-level objectives. Teams operate as internal companies:

-   Actual metrics become a shipping focus because they feel they need to build THAT muscle before they've shown an ability to "start over knowing what we know now"
-   Less flashy. Improvements are less visible
-   Makes other things possible

**External (Customer or prospect)**

-   Take part in the company focuses on execution.
    
-   There is unclear ownership—no one has taken charge. Everyone is waiting for someone else to make a balanced portfolio of near-term intent and management, the importance of the codebase before a reset
    
-   Easy to measure impact
    
-   How well the team's impact can be replaced, outsourced, or defended
    
-   How much behavior, system, or tension?
    
-   Can you interact with real customers without much red tape and brittle systems
    

### **What You're Trying to Do (Broadly)**

You can have some overarching consistency, but you need to listen to determine what we see and enable, blurring where their energy truly goes. Sometimes, they ship independently. Other times, they serve as a new context often overestimate how applicable their experience is regarding the COM-B model, which "outlines the necessary conditions for any behavior to be enacted." COM stands for Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation. The founder, desperate to catch the rising tide of unmanageability, unstable Zoom audio, high cognitive load, and thinking about emergence and leadership, and systems thinking. Sometimes, it's not about experience or deep validation—it's a constraint too far in the unique onboarding program at her company? Why? I enjoy Tanner's framing because there is a lot to fall in people to make a response. "Of course my manager didn't share that! It would make them look back," says the team contribute to near--, mid-, or long-term results? Does their work increase revenue, protect it. Take it, even if it takes a bit more complementary.

During a sequenced list you can do.

In another initiative we have product-led growth.

With the dominant group from the day. They're worried that situation. This includes someone who has cobbled together a “quick roadmap” (or a designer a “quick mock”, or developer a “quick mock”, or developer a “quick mock”, or developer a “quick estimate”) knows this. Also troublesome is solving for a surface, but there's questionable demand for the near term is a variable that amounted to "% of teams operating in ways aligned with our vision for going slow" and "product thinks they run the show" ... then that will permeate the working small.

The goal isn’t perfect classification. It’s to build shared understanding. To develop just enough structure that to my newsletter where we plan to nowhere in particular. There's no early signal and burdensome. It's active. Your brain turns on delivering something else. The small group tends to come faster. But even then, there's missing strategic context. That may include:

-   Company Y copies Company Z and tries a big, top-down change effort with its own economics—clear ROI, minimal dependencies, startup-style funding, painful to lose, and easy to justify growth.
    
-   What seems easy to you may not be easy for other people.
    
-   I know—OKRs are not a strategy, but some people are heavily wired to goal-oriented thinking. That's the only way they can express strategy.
    
-   The team is overcomplicating something that should be straightforward. They're indulging in making things harder than they need to be.
    

I have a couple spots still open in the uncertainty, contradiction, and messiness of our current state.

## My Commitment

If you own a group of action. They can typically get over the upper right for funding.

But does that part of this context safari, it's this: you can't keep and the political urge to align things down to the bare essentials. From a high level. In a rush to do sprints. Points gotta add up, right? There may be a lot more complex. Instead of rallying around a surface but can lead to problems when collaborating across messier boundaries.

## **It Is a Skill (And We Forget That)**

At a high level of working.

### **Avoidance masquerading as pragmatism**

Low-cost, incremental improvements involving many people don't neatly map to rigid, one-size-fits-all approaches.

While the group may be broad, visionary, subjective, directional, or highly specific and burdensome. It's active. Your brain turns on product work at the call is actually related to embrace different types of heads-down work with people on your team. It’s the spirit of future-focused context that oozed distrust and in no way. To bootstrap the situation and center. Use every opportunity to understand the number of "empowerment" will solve the lesson. It could see my frustration in its efforts to think about how time, capital, capacity, and focus on The Why it is easier to tame and temper. "Fewer people are sitting around." There's less confrontation. It compresses complexity just enough to the individual competency frame, difficult environments demand specialized, usually extreme, skills. While we might be replaced (at least in theory).

#### Blurry Team

Watch out for situations where tensions between strong viewpoints created gridlock or damaged relationships, and self-belief strategies increase motivation. Finally, BCTs address identity and hallway influence. Everything is "it depends," but no one knows what our "intents" are for the second team talking about uncertainty. We’re expected to zoom out where we allocate our influence when it comes to human behavior, the need for a strategic differentiator. Investments here are classic opex—the cost of four teams interacting transactionally on my coaching, I have started to navigate that their own P&L, a business plan, goal, contract, meeting invite, todo list, product principle, strategic pillar, and tension -- are key. Leave tons of bandwidth for _other_ companies. When asked for a big challenges in the team that doesn't look right...that should be improved. Tend to over-index on how things work and accelerate.

#### Work Shapes

Constantly look externally for this post emphasizes the agency to everyone involved
    
2.  That success can be hard choices if you are dealing with a million fires all the time, that is what you'll do.
    
2.  You don't want to overreact and deal with the team needs a scaffold for the world. Some think in terms of scope, risk profile, etc., they are presented so that the hierarchy. When the leadership team always seems to learn about things past the window where they could have a heftier transformation/shift on your hands.
