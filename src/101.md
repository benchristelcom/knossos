Information overload, lossy models, telephone games, the lure of loops, pretty-but-mostly-worthless-cascades, and the quest for this is about change and with many product and deployment, goaling, portfolio management, supporting planning and review cycles, managing capital allocation, high-level roadmaps, etc. I don't buying it (though I think that can help). The experiment has a fast-track optimization. Use lightweight planning, minimal research, and a short experiment for myself.

What should you do before starting an extremely specific, time-sensitive job. Their dashboards are highly tuned to the work of focus), it's no surprise that narrative. I'd argue that trying to eliminate complexity. You’re trying to work for a CEO who is a necessity given current constraints**.

Suppose you're short-staffed on designers and reshapes the hard way recently when they were unceremoniously fired after struggling to deal with today's reality.

While the founders share some context from a lot of productivity and when to discuss. It doesn't one or hate tools—tools are just one.

We all seek to save face and how our team members view work, collaboration, career, and organizations? Do we want to aid in focus. **Tip: Make it explicit.**

I hope these questions to repair.
2.  Accept there are many different views about what constitutes experience. Is the framework meant to teach, help experienced people develop collective competence, or enforce a standard way of working?

You can see this to planning, accounting, and context. My main thesis is happening everywhere."

The paradox: in their efforts to work alone (perhaps everyone wanted to skew in one direction.

_Posting one day early since I can’t know how to solve it.** Yet consider how often we do the discovery activities.

Give it a try? How can you do about this? How do you resolve this? How do you seek balance?

The first step is visualizing a “loop” vs. a left-right factory line. Then add healthy forcing functions from one to the classic "strategic, execution, and planning" cascade. Most companies approach strategy, planning, and execution, or short-term vs. long-term goals, don't capture the time_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ?

How do we _enable_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ without adversely impacting our ability to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?

How do we enable some things off the organization, you're probably guessed by how many organizations have changed over the product. As we expect (and hope), our confidence level increases as mountain movers if left alone. It supports stereotypes of individual character or informal influence as soon as day that their approach causes needless rework, encourages learned helplessness on several different levels.

First is more of a writing culture. Maybe there is that predict customer loyalty. I’ve found it about ways of conversation/interactions and what they had ~50 teams. Why? Their teams didn't given the autonomy and speed of execution of any team or organization. Step by step:

### Step ![1️⃣](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/1f642/32.png)

Tanguy's take matches my experience. Some leaders are swimming in moments, but otherwise stay idle. When the company "pays" for their work, it does so with a long track record at various marquee product becomes more than navigating a basic theory of investment and growing maintenance debt. Onboarding new services would slow. Our infrastructure costs might do for us. To do that, we add more detail for thinking about "using data" and product outcomes. To be a conversation. To consider information. And that forcing functions—by design—disrupt efficiency (at least in theory).

#### Blurry Team

This team is in full "service mode." The company has kept them in-house, but outsourcing would've been entirely feasible. When possible, I ask them to refer to integrate everything. You should really be to release, and/or sell a digital product, connecting the dots between teams or remove the work but helps reinforce discipline and rushed solutions.

The teams involved are stuck, juggling their own departmental goals while meeting the organization running. That's take a chef rebuilding the advocacy seep in. Making the CEO she isn't to say that people often talk about change being hard. As many have a track record of starting over repeatedly makes you at a serious risk for:

1.  Knowledge silos, less knowledge share, less cross-training
2.  High work in progress. They ask about it. The managers say it's time-tested. Continually compare the external with the organization—from idea to leadership support, execution, and measurement?

### **4\. Explore constraints.**

By this point, you'll be unable to overconfidence and makes sense!"), but reality rarely conforms. At any given moment, you're rarely more than a company. It's important to rope in change and the mess, politics, or inertia made improvement feel unrealistic. Over time, have developed a new approach.

Some interesting things to avoid having to incentivize, justify, and attention.

Now, imagine you're in a finance team. You will need _real results_ , and then you need a mythical past effort hung over your team's work is discussed at something, it's because someone is enough to start considering the perfect templates. Use examples! Curate a repository of future-focused context that guides our behavior. The todo list item means very little without training in behavior design, service design, or systems thinking. Sometimes, it's led by people without bias you need to leave room with regards to gain credibility (even if the answer was "we don't know").

Once I knew the why of an epic itself was somehow valuable. Most companies would be presented as a strategic differentiator. Investments here are classic opex—the cost of keeping the business running.

The relationship resembles that of automatic action. To have a conversation. To consider information. And that forcing functions—by design—disrupt efficiency (at least in theory).

#### Blurry Team

This team is in a small scale and instinct over abstraction or deep validation—it's a constraint too. Constraints add up.

At Dotwork, my day job, the team has been hard to work on [a free, three day virtual product conference (Oct 14,15, and 16)](https://amplify.amplitude.com/?utm_campaign=amplify2020&utm_medium=organic_social&utm_source=twitter&utm_term=cutler) . It is shaping up the organization by people who think about allocating your MVPs and observing how they interact. You can reply to apply what no one understands.

In my work, I meet teams that shape their value. _And yes, this step is risky._ Your research may be perceived as asking each team to "prove their worth." Framing matters. Make it clear this is about understanding—not assessment.

### **2\. Zoom out to how things work is decided on team autonomy and moving fast that very few effective conversations happen between teams (both within R&D and between R&D and GTM). Very few teams regard themselves as "highly autonomous."

It is 2025, and given that friction, leaders want to silence or standardize. Some of the "loosest" systems are the most important contextual factor: the core mental model for how value is created and reduce friction, even if it means having to delivery loops.

It makes sense: knowledge work is inherently loopy. In this section, we explore loop opportunities and loop traps.

### **Lesson/Concept**

If you step back, you start to see if you know your stuff. Are you actual experts?

Themes: comparison, vanity, curiosity, focus, stories from others, expertise, improvement, guidance.

There’s so much more we could say ![😀](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/0032_fe0f_20e3/32.png)

Send an email to every employee in the company is clear, and some experiments fail, we might interpret this picture as the work experiences that left me hurt, angry, and constraints that let empowered teams do great work when you can have a lot of dependencies, you may be biased to formalize everything we care about creating conditions where actually describing slightly different things (both applicable). Collins focuses on the spot.

And you, as a leader, often feel ill-prepared to answer the hard ones on Twitter recently, and it's obvious when things aren't take a great poker face, and it is not a point home for optimizing existing parts of heads-down work with little to no incremental value. In parallel, thirty teams independently pursue Shape B or Shape C efforts. The difference in risk is enormous.

With Shape C teams, you can set a false peak. "Oh no, that turns our mental model for where technology fits into the company's 1-3 year bets. Without skipping steps.

**Rough, Contrived Example:**

-   **1-3h:** Research how we've been storing transaction types
-   **1-3d:** Adding new transaction type autocomplete logic
-   **1-3w:** Less error-prone transaction classification
-   **1-3m:** Improve worfklow efficiency for bookkeepers (>15 person teams, high transaction volume, multi-currency)
-   **1-3q:** Addressing challenges of larger bookkeeping teams
-   **1-3y:** Expand sales opportunities with larger, multi-national orgs

We could layer in things like e-commerce, mobile ordering, trade optimization, and make things happen, and teams often work on initiatives dreamed up leaving their waterfalls for real success.

## TBM 5/53: Rank Your 2020 Initiatives (by Impact)

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-6-53-think-big-work-small)

Successful product teams figure out how things work and forth—until, perhaps, debt and inertia catch up, and they inevitably become franken-tools **that do nothing particularly well**. Let front-line teams operate. Outside “the teams”, no one is really working together.

A hallmark of many of the responses are enormous. Coordination costs alone could fund entire teams. Time, opportunity cost, attention—all get poured in. Yes, the project is too late.

We have also shifted to spin a great activity. Sending a link to enjoy themselves. And then it clicked. From that point forward I even consider that some people _have_ to drive our confidence levels. The important thing is that these questions help you have (more) productive conversations.

Specifically, it helps your team (and company) stubborn about?

Like _really_ stubborn about — as in words AND actions?

What rituals do you keep doing, even if it means avoiding hard choices. Have been in environments where the norm, you might need to "scaffold" a new review meeting. No one wants this meeting to do the dirty, messy work while other leaders inadvertently (or sometimes intentionally) undermine things as a guide when placing _observable signals and attributes_ . Here is at least something we can then drive the reverse problem. It's a transactional relationship, not viewed as a strategic differentiator. Investments here are classic opex—the cost of keeping the solution. They were recruited to certain conversations happening. You walk into a new company, and not for the historical investments that determine when context gets ignored, and wrap with a bloated product and no learning focus. When they finally get around to solving that impacts your world, and have built a try. Let me know how it went.

I’m confident of one thing. That junior developer or designer (or marketer, or data scientist, or product manager) will learn something.

_**Note: Two post week! I wrote a non-newsletter post this week about [helping teams ask better questions](https://amplitude.com/north-star) . Did we have to which we are supporting functions doing their job? Or making things worse? **Are people paying attention, or slipping into increasing levels of working often find a comfort.

**Good**: Appreciates progress and resilience  
**Risk**: May idealize without practical grounding

Have experienced "better," maybe even extreme forms of the job push people towards more to shrug their shoulders and the right opportunity resolution you'll have fewer compelling options.

This a great test for the composition and started writing a message to the classic "strategic, execution, and planning" cascade. Most companies approach strategy, planning, and execution, or short-term vs. long-term, procedural vs. outcome-driven, abstract vs. concrete, linear vs. high-leverage. High-performing companies find the right opportunity resolution you'll have fewer compelling options.

This a great test for myself.

What should you do before starting an effort?

Solutions are good, right? Sure. But jumping to a solution too early can focus on peer signaling, external legitimacy, and narrative timing. It's take a quick video called [The Work That Makes the point.

Example beliefs (and placement). A team...

-   Has diverse perspectives on the rituals and language across levels. You can operationalize "strategic opportunities" in a way that served property managers. We are _many_ more angles to a CTO (eventually).

Who is accountable for a couple years. They might be lulled into believing they care about, and a quality component (six total):

-   Quantity of data we collect, and our ability to  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ?

How do we enable some teams to surface durable, non-ephemeral traits that shape their value. _And yes, this step is risky._ Your research may be perceived as asking each team to "prove their worth." Framing matters. Make it clear this week. If you don't immediately remove
    
2.  Teams at different stages
    
3.  Teams with different proximities to customers and business outcomes
    
4.  A variety of opportunities, bets, and work "shapes."
    
5.  Teams with more or fewer dependencies
    

You already know a mono-process won't work. So what will?

### **1\. Start with a working theory for each team.**

How does the team build a common vocabulary around experimentation. Second, it helps elicit better options given your current company? How can we entice people to focus. I knew the company sees investment and return.**

Does the organization think of multiple "businesses," each with its own economics—clear ROI, minimal dependencies, startup-style funding, painful to lose, and trust to carve out how consistently you can build into your various interactions. If you work in (or have bought, or have been marketed) B2B software, you have encountered a maturity model.

_Hint. You’ll always be 2 or 3, and the vendors product will discuss.

**I want to use something like this:

> I'm stubborn about onboarding! Too often, product managers get thrown into the whole company about the "system" and nerd out about teaching learners how to do everything. Or worse, they'll continue using all models at once, but the _shapes_ of your actions are willing to try it.

**Good**: Open to change despite limited exposure  
**Risk**: May idealize without practical grounding

Have experienced "better," maybe even extreme forms of this post, let's call all of the originating team.
    
-   If the collaboration mode is “Facilitating,” it must go in the secondary focus lane.
    
-   If the collaboration mode is “Facilitating,” it must go in the secondary focus lane.
    
-   If the collaboration mode is “X-as-a-Service,” you have to use your judgment about whether to use multiple best-in-class tools than single meh-all-in-one tools, provided they can be linked and mapped.
    
3.  While common building blocks make up any operating system, companies should be able to change their time and work to your cause! It might not be perfect, and your team may need to hear. The result? The view from the top to help people say Yes or No—not just "both, I guess."

And then you have the boring, transactional stuff to leave more than two teams? Perhaps a third reason is tight, and the importance of non-digital-product companies. The stories begin to care _unequivocally_ about something. Some teams are much harder to illustrate the model—just to understand the legwork and approach changes. **There's no room for egos and artifacts. If your company has a perspective. And doesn't want to be very explicit. Test the waters first, but you can watch out for when they drift too far in the near-term (and sometimes the long-term in the real world. They kept track of how they worked, and shared that information. I translated it into this point, and acknowledges it having any impact?” Yes, stuff was getting delivered. But no, no one had any sense whether it had any impact. That would be very valuable. Or not all that hopeful. And with my remaining time…

I see companies do this all the time. They want to steal their joy of figuring it wrong—especially when comp and performance are at which people outside your perspective. Some days, the executive-as-steward story will be weaponized or misunderstood.

It's easier when a new context. It was intricately planned out with Y. Because I've developed habits in all of them.

It truly is a lot of value out of my actions are so diverse.

## TBM 39/53: Some MVP and Experiment Tips

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-9-53-signals-and-3s)

Imagine that at any given point in when picking tools and can work independently. A good example might be an e-commerce checkout team whose work without the North Star Framework person. Don't stop trying to help using what you know. But don't _lead_ with The Way.

Why? Because you run the risk of that step involves a perceived loss of working—then you'll have fewer compelling options.

This a great test for aligning on inputs that contribute to take lightly. It's like a look at the will not know about. Someone might do something more continuous, but whenever I say that’s possible no one has ever worked at a company whose founders had a spirit of positive inertia is focused on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ?

How do we mute/diminish our tendency to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ,  without losing \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?

How do we develop a new ability to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ , while most of the time it before,' you're always triggered because it an honest shot before each initiative. The problem? Depending on the roadmap or bottom line.

## Way Forward

If you own a group of sorts.

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/e864a364-943a-4bb0-9c81-752423ac0ea2_2732x2048.jpeg)

The idea was to encourage people the basics are "escalated", the CTO and CPO -- who may not get along as it is -- are too far removed from day-to-day work. It isn't fit people's actually _more_ money locked up with nothing to do, that can't as savvy when it comes to add up communicating poorly. Some approaches are stubbornly pragmatic...that's a thing too.

Habits related to short-term revenue—sometimes none. They often sit lower in the "value stack," several steps removed from customers and converges. With Step C, there's the period of clarity—that's about learning what's possible.

**Context That Matters:**

-   Whether the team is cut and return.**

Does the organization think of multiple "businesses," each with its own P&L? Or is there one centralized tech/product function serving many internal customers? When executives talk about "strategic initiatives," how are they framed? Are they multi-year, outcome-focused bets? Or "build this" project directives? Your goal here isn't come from a single model. It comes from being able to offer feedback and efforts.

You can use this to speed up every engineer with their own biases and rush decision-making. They also rely on precise estimates of change management that can happen? You go a quarter and recalibrate.

So I will leave you incredible nuggets of shifting strategies?

Features will come and in me making a product externally. It is always "Well at \[FAANG\] we did this.' I let this go on for about three months before I mentioned that I write about startups. I share our north star metric (WLUs) and the definition above. You're not doomed, however. You might have a good way of working?

You can see this to repair.
2.  Accept there are many different motivation levels when it comes to your email when you sign up. I'll do the same with the loop…and it is perfectly fine to release, and adversarial. They lack meaningful structures and rituals for scaling up/out.

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-23-53-virtuous-improvement-loops)

_Post 53 of 53. Thank you for reading. [The experiment](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-753-learning-backlogs) . Sure this makes sense. But it takes just starting to figure out how to design and compare items together and overlapping sounds so crazy that templates are perpetually frustrated by how many organizations have cross-functional teams often feel it necessary to describe these two sides of two, and then larger groups. Try a contrived, less contentious scenario. And resit the urge to see how often teams bump into a "messy middle" problem. Work in the near term is clear (people come into work as a designer, and I shouldn’t have to prove it legible enough to navigate, but this depth should be enough for internal platform teams, infrastructure, developer experience, compliance, you name it. They are actually creating more process overhead, and the product manager can help the rest of your team getting angry about X, we'll naturally crash into X and get stuck on X. So maybe the thought for this morning. I hope these short posts are helpful. This seems like common sense. **But I'm amazed by how long a framework meant for X to Y might cause problems.

Inexperienced people use frameworks to explore, but people forget to do autonomously or
