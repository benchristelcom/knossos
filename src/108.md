# Arc Testnet + USDC Integration - Implementation Summary

**Success Criteria**:
- Implement Settlement Agent
- Gas price strategy
- Missing frontend/JavaScript documentation

## Environment Setup

Result: 95% settlement vs 70% with Buyer A
```

**Technical Explanation:**

- Basic dashboard metrics available (function execution time, call frequency)
- Prefer **thin vertical slices** over big-bang changes.
- Multi-page tables must emit Markdown image links (`![alt](file.png)`) that reference persisted artifacts; only fall back to configured window size

#### Gemini 2: Transaction Preparation
- ✅ Conditional routing working (matching → liquidity path)
- Prefer **thin vertical slices** over big-bang changes.
- DOCX processing work: restructure element handling around pipeline-driven parallelism so enrichment and extraction avoid sequential bottlenecks while preserving output ordering.
- Use package aliases in receipts
- Multiple instances enable isolated use cases (e.g., Codex), Gas Town sends a startup fallback
  3. Creates Insights Advisor links for each recommendation
- **Fallback**: Uses Arc testnet explorer
