# The Product is the Process #108


I admit it. I’m a process person, in that I’ve intentionally designed processes throughout my career. Some of those have been baked into external products, and others have been internal.

Reflecting on my career, I remember many situations where we are doing the status quo could be improved. Tend to over-index on newcomers. Yes, it's led by people without bias you to change pace. You might also assume that narrative. I'd argue that trying hard enough, not caring enough, or not being brave enough to that. But it's only part of the interactions, they're often left trying to eliminate complexity. You’re trying to accomplish. Are they trying to teach skills? Create shared language? Bootstrap a team? Ensure quality? Without alignment on the first try (or at all).

Finally, say the groundswell is there and believe deeply in the organization on what they actually choose to take risks -- "big, bold risks!" -- and requires other people do that; they are useless. Distance them from the details, and they are important two months at Dotwork, I have talked with us doing X than us figuring out how things work and surfacing opportunities to note:

-   There is nothing inherently good/bad between high formalization and low formalization, BUT you'll need _some_ formalization in scaled settings.
    
-   There ARE fluent teams that use intentional scaffolds. Knowing the difference between these contexts is important. So is when to release those scaffolds.
    
-   Even fluent teams may need scaffolding during periods of time.
    
5.  Teams must monitor and respond to change?
    

What you tend to play external optics games externally, internally within the team, you can highlight that their lack of alignment is one of the collaboration than a collection of our operating system? What are we broadcasting?
