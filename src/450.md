## Runtime Configuration

When editing Markdown (`*.md`, `*.mdx`):

- Read `.instructions/golang.md` and announce once per task that you are following it.
- If you choose to **import**, the extension reads a JSON file you select and merges snippets into local storage.

## Testing

### Rebase

## Project Overview
- **Image uploads** are processed at `/editor_upload_image` endpoint
- **WebAssembly Streaming**: 200-400ms with streaming vs 400-800ms without
- **Benefits**: No old file cleanup, auto cache-busting with `?t=timestamp`
- **Components**: Interactive controls, real-time display, result visualization

### Environment Variables
- `execute_code()`: Execute code, capture stdout/stderr, return `REPLResult`
- Started REST API on port 8000
- ✅ Has proper Goal_Velocity and Acceleration set
- ⚠️ Examples that don't require RMT5 hardware will run more smoothly in QEMU
