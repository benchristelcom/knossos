## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### 3. Memory Management
- **Tools**: get_market_price, calculate_volatility, get_market_depth
- **SFML 3**: Static site generator with version management, build system, and release procedures
- **Address**: `0x9A676e781A523b5d0C0e43731313A708CB607508`
- **Usage**: Singleton cluster-scoped resource named "cluster"
- **Low-level**: "Zod schema validation syntax", "Cloudflare Workers KV usage", "PostgreSQL connection pooling"
- **Scope**: Cluster-scoped resource

### Primary Build System (CMake)
```python
# CloudWatch Logs
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/products/1/reserve-stock \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"quantity": 50}'

# Reserve stock
5. chaptermarks.rst - Move to features
python main.py --config chat.yaml --from docs/ --streaming query "Explain RAG"
```

**chat** - Interactive conversation mode:
```python
@Test
├── tsconfig.json
│       │   └── style.min.css.gz
3. **Never assume** API signatures, binding syntax, or SDK methods

### Core Components
- **Fix**: Implemented lazy loading via `__getattr__`
- **Status**: **RESOLVED** - All imports now work cleanly

---

## Next Steps (Optional)

### Security Features Demonstrated

Before writing code:
- [ ] Detected project language/framework from manifest files
- [ ] Git workflow is configurable per project

---

### 2. Payment Tools

**Example tasks requiring frontend instructions:**
- "Create a complete user registration system"
- "Style the merchant dashboard with Tailwind"
- "Add validation to the withdrawal controller"
- "Build a comprehensive reporting dashboard"

## Efficient Usage Guidelines

### Phase 2: Configure Your Test Scenario

✅ **All 6 tests passed successfully**

1. Railway will automatically start building
rg -c "
import os
pkill -f logs/streamlit_payment_demo.log`
2. **Use dedicated wallet** - Create new wallet with limited funds

### Choose an Agent Template
3.  **Action panel**: Approve / Reject (with scope selector) / Approve with modification. For T2/T3, show execution plan for real-time!

---

## ✅ **Verification Checklist**

The **Settlement Agent** is the merchant agent.

## 4. Flujo de Interacción Típico (Ejemplo: Cotización Solar)

Task is used for `staging` and `production` environments. For detailed deployment instructions, please refer to the appropriate query file (or create new one following the pattern):

**Example in `client/src/queries/useQueryFixedPrompt.tsx`**:

```tsx
npm install @convex-dev/sharded-counter
```

Or use backticks:
```python
# Install uv (first time)
wrangler secret list

# 2. Restore from most recent backup
GAS_PRICE_MULTIPLIER=1.0        # $1 USDC
Documentation: https://testnet.arcscan.app/tx/0x...
```
