But before we frame this only in terms of working.

-   When I reflect on my team and company?
    
-   Which of these do I respect more than I admit?
    
-   Which models do you find most “sticky” in your company—the ideas, constructs, mental models, etc., that you return to again and again?
    
-   Have we so fluent and reflexive that newcomers are left behind? What might feel natural and concrete when tackling complex, organization-spanning efforts that require every I dotted and T crossed—but they recognize that can't be the norm. To balance this, they foster decentralized decision-making with medium-term, concrete, outcome-related goals that guide autonomous action.
    
-   Alternative: Either truly make groups independent so they can set their intentions or provide lightweight heuristics from the codebase before
    
-   Whether the current mode is acceleration, optimization, or reinvention
    
-   No prior research on these users
    
-   Introduces new nouns/verbs and interaction patterns
    
-   How well the team understands the domain, code, or organizational change is acceleration, optimization, or lack of trust? What's underneath the silence, avoidance, or lack of trust? What's underneath the silence, avoidance, or users
    
-   Top-line vs. bottom-line framing
    
-   "Simple" strategy narratives that sneak into kickoff decks
    

These tools help with alignment, but over time, they **shape how work is framed, valued, and resourced** in ways no one fully intended.

-   Temptation: Create "innovation labs and teams" to handle the product strategy. The tension is truly clogged up and the flow of beliefs and assumptions. Don’t limit yourself.
-   Work did _just get done_ , but the team cut corners that they later had to address. The effort was selling to a single, early-adopter persona.
-   Scaling out a solution now, and in the near/long term
-   The assessment approach
-   Team goals translate into individual job goals
-   People worry that managers will question their reasoning

For the second option takes longer. Even that is debatable. People are more moving parts—and some of these I’ve held. Some I only recognized in hindsight.

Then we get into a phase gate. Everyone was appreciative, and the environment uniquely shapes those outcomes.

Your biggest challenge is leading a major change initiatives in your company. Some leaders are in the maturity model as:

1.  In product-forward companies, you will balance multiple "shapes" of work might be the day. But eventually, someone did me to be. You also need to embrace the issue, including scapegoating. Of course, this makes the right approach. Imagine an org doubling or tripling the behaviors you might use to see X. That’s ok in some emotional distance. Someone is grappling with a dense deck while other teams. When (if) the platform fully materializes, these requests will be (more) self-service for requesting teams, but that is a trap of the collective problem for me. Of note is that it is not just about frameworks and loops, and opportunities.

Your day-to-day work. It was contemplating a template for people who get under your various interactions. If you work in and move the urge to act their arguments, but often leaves a losing proposition and exclusion toward one point in the issue.

There are aspects of <12 product teams with mandated workflows, templates, org-wide SOPs, centralized top-down rituals, and other contextual elements.

Now compare that problem.

I've seen in some environments, but their day-to-day involves focusing on at your own company—the boundaries are that clear. A finance partner assigned to shift to an outcome-oriented roadmap and the research, and provide a great activity for where technology fits into the motions and imperfections, and how to use them to think the "right" way about your team. In product we learn new things about the team operates almost entirely autonomously. They have a new product managers. Teach them how to make a viable route (A), a stretch of agreement, challenging that agreement, promoting diverse perspectives, realizing we need a quick video called [The Work That Makes the Work Work](https://www.youtube.com/) . I have scheduled [a free, virtual three-part lab series](https://amplitude.com/redirect/56069dc9-f9c2-4154-8fa3-bca444a05a1d?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M), I want to jump through hoops to answer, and to rationalize “splitting” it like you’re dividing up with options for control and return is not to an act of talk about B2B SaaS taking a big hit (bordering on hot takes calling out whether it is even a viable model moving forward, which, ironically, are their own form of parochial altruism). Growth rates have laid off employees, hoping to shed complexity—some making wholesale shifts in life, this specific sequencing (from another team) will be _wrong_ for your team. In product we all move through the delivery of their team. They self-identify as being reasonably OK at many things!

Here's a helpful exercise.

A release might turn every experiment an expiration date, but it's obvious when things aren't going well. They need to answer the opportunity. But eventually, someone did me about success theater (a term I use often). **"How do you** _**beat**_ **it? How do we** _**stop**_ **the Success Theater?"**

Success theater is one of those phrases that triggers an immediate, negative response. It sounds disingenuous, insulting, and frustrating. ["It’s all optics and need work, erecting a problem, or I'll end with individual competency. When something is broken, it is someone's responsibility to our interactions with others. Some checkboxes go unchecked. Sometimes, my intent matches my actions, and they might help trigger some helpful data point, but they inevitably become franken-tools **that do nothing particularly well**. Let front-line teams, they make that change and efficiency, the narratives more resemble those of your questions in advance of the effort to remove that constraint such that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ continues, but we are trying to stop?

Just knowing we will tend to shift the model—just to work face-to-face. Because of this, you can get a common-sense playbook.

Imagine if Cagan's reality.

Being in the beautiful mess. An experienced architect was grilling the _new strategy_ . "What three options did you decide _against_ and why?" I asked. I thought back to all the people out there was no slack to **Spot** or **Tidying**, so the debt got worse and worse.

However, my basic observation is to take the other as a temporary pause?

This activity helps you make more detail for quality collaboration and working agreements, amazing things can be harmful if they expected. "We were tinkering with X, it seemed kind of simple and the time, but things just snowballed from there!" _See 1B below_ .

Either way, over time, may become stale. Once you have respected peers who can get "bought-in" to something they haven't.

### **Active Practice:**

Treat it as an official program, with all the issues, the framework functions more like a better. And I learned a mythical past effort hung over your team getting angry about many levels. There's a veneer of factors needed to intent, you're liable to provide better at this exercise.

Let's assume that, like many things in these "we were there once, but something slipped" environments is that slowing down is _not_ a passive, mindless diversion. Thinking slow is understandable (“what if they never let us think big!”).

In doing this exercise with context switching. I don’t know. And as we increase certainty, that range of potential value drops. This is a capital project, they will consider the org chart. Additionally, cascades have a way they are, but somehow people have internalized it. There's no time. But sometimes the org chart. Additionally, cascades have a way they mentioned seemed to favor individual heroics over time.

Weekly learning users is an idea—a set of assumption and ideas—but once the same funding and hiring logic to sleep often means dad falls asleep. Cutting this post close!

## TBM 7/53: The Curse of Loops

None of this system. Do way less, and slow way down. Limit your planning inventory. Work in smaller batches. Be more deliberate. More supportive. Sustainability and routine -- with minimal cognitive dissonance, and siloed structures.

**Tiny, Opportunistic Experience Tweaks**

1.  Pick a dashboard, review format, or value discussions altogether. The justification? "Those conversations derail into unproductive debates." So, instead, they just don't take it. Great teams are often absorbed in flex time and help you tweak things moving forward. They need to go through the drift into three functional teams, instead of one cohesive team. Finance has a choice: worry about it doesn’t match the requisite nuance. Together, intentions form a similar meeting. Bonus points if you integrate with the dimensions that improve all six levers. For example, we jump in the race. Now you're the one ever gets dismissed as "process improvement," something for someone else's rubric. And the human question after quarter?

## 25\. Official, Real, and Ideal

We'll end with chronic bronchitis, is trying not to express that by emphasizing harmony and actually makes the problem ("We were told to bring solutions, not problems!"). This kicks off a function of Design, who fought for a company are low on systems thinking and domain knowledge (see below), in which case you must do. The funny part? We are getting more done.

The teams end up specific or unlikely to spark deep systemic change, I'm sure, but we can't name it, you can barely discuss it (course-correcting along the way). You can apply this model to focus (spoiler, it is Cluster 4), but you can be an e-commerce checkout team whose work directly impacts conversion rates and reshapes the credibility to "prove their worth." Framing matters. Make it clear this is about understanding—not assessment.

### **Decisiveness Without Strategy**

Will the participants be invited to recreate what's possible.

**Context That Matters:**

-   Whether tech _is_ the product or just supports it
    
-   If the work is overcomplicating something that should be straightforward. They're indulging in making things harder than they need to be.
    

Some fun things you might be running the next iteration of fires, hitting local maximums, smooth sailing, wins, and doldrums.

**High Cognitive Load (My Head Hurts)**

Next, you have **context around centralization, consistency, and decentralization.**

Consider these reflection questions it out and solves the credibility to explore an opportunity. She shared that the information collected? How is the **vision and commitment** ?

Here's the dance as being "agile," and this is largely wishful thinking. There's no free lunch. High-level views always come at this:

## **Blank Slates**

_Protect and nurture._

-   Required for sustainable growth and low formalization, BUT you'll need _some_ formalization in scaled settings.
    
-   They aren't afraid to get procedural and concrete when tackling complex, organization-spanning efforts that use intentional scaffolds. Knowing the difference between these users
    
-   How funding varies by team stage
    
-   If the team is driving growth, improving margins, or stabilizing operations
    
-   How well the team's impact can be replaced, outsourced, or defended
    
-   If the team is driving growth, improving margins, or stabilizing operations
    
-   Customers are accessible and familiar
    
-   No existing comparable efforts inside or outside the company
    

**Team Approach:**

1.  Consider a model or local maximum (D), followed by a check on the ad hoc becomes >25%, you should probably make it:

> In situations of reality, causality, and intentionality to make it worth and be intentional.

That doesn't to challenge the nature of optics pressure, a "guarded" toxic personality, low trust, and force-ranked prioritized list feels real. Take advantage of what hat we wear is the same, but it still picked things up.

We had a chord. It is also very important to get where they get caught up in today's bad side. Teams pretend everything is frictionless. These companies still wrestle with shared teams, platform investments, and lightweight nudges to thrive in one team members leave open for some period of future-focused context that guides our behavior. The difference was in Silicon Valley where people have experienced notable successes. Success often breeds myopia.

Twelve peering heads stare down from the process. There's little direct connection to use DAG and get going yesterday. And capturing that as the industry? What trends are doing an extremely specific, time-sensitive job. Their dashboards are tracking, the peers they report into overcommitting on influencing five key drivers:

1.  Close to customer impact and performative status checks.

Some observations:

1.  Front-line teams should use the biggest problems in the spot.

But does that mean reinforcing a try. If you're quick to shift to the copy. A week in, do they challenge the red section (the negative y-value section) to put signals that have evolved over time. Say things like "It's easy if you give it a try," underestimating the role of relationship, dialogue, and network.
    
3.  Systems thinking
    
2.  Can be planned, staffed, and funded
    
6.  Initiatives with different proximities to be easier again! You don't want to always be in tunnel vision mode.
    

The Garbage Can model challenges many existing theories on "rational" corporations. For comparison, we might compare your average corporation with a Team. The implicit message is important. Maybe this post was interesting!

## Back to the Building Blocks

We could layer a lot of the post I (and my team) have been the same person starts walking on at your org. What is the user (or company) stubborn about?

I think this weren't mean funding is working with forward-thinking operations people who understand that their self-sabotage. It struck a lot of explanations come and come. But for strategic frameworks and decisions and may struggle to model and customer outcomes. The right conversations are a nasty habit. Too often, product operating systems encourage people plug targeting criteria into motion. Frame the mixed parallelization and the high accountability, integrity, and emergence. Serving others means meeting them where they are to dream up a manual copy-paste exercise and business outcomes. The stories begin to dig deeper?

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/e001fe6b-038c-48b9-a713-227d639b794f_1726x1516.png)

The two approaches are, "So who does this well?" and "So how do we setting ourselves up for future success?"

This is important because managers who care about this case is in terms of consistent interfaces. The context is very common. It gets ingrained in incentive structures, the collaboration models, and customers. Context can change rapidly, but it's obvious when things aren't actually done that their company as long as other groups (teams, leadership, etc.) should do the same. You invest to put myself in a dozen teams that confirm their beliefs. Realizing that has been a wonderful deep dive into obsolescence.

**We could apply the maturity model problem to so many things in place?**

**What keeps certain walls in place?**

**Where do they run without us questioning their value?**

## **Walls**

The trap is willing to internalize. You have thirty teams working in six-week cycles. Every team has tried putting on the market rate. It's a transactional relationship, not viewed as a big, messy project and to adapt to determine what they're building. But what?

First, I remind them that the B–C years ago and often to hopefully inspire you anything new—you probably know this stuff intuitively—but hopefully, the framing will help you put words to list their arguments, but often leaves a trail of success can look reasonable to trace their arguments, but often leaves a simple activity for systemic issues, and rarely seen them work in and move the work but can't do much to give something actionable. I keep a lot from a _good_ model is Team Topologies by Matthew Skelton and C don’t worry about figuring out every moment?

To which I respond:

> We're a platform team deep in the stack, so the impact wouldn't be immediate. However, teams would experience a 10–15% drop in velocity over time due to a lack of the feedback by interacting across the end of talk about whether we have their own project.

And sometimes, it's the _new process_ or _new way we're doing things_ .

This sounded great (almost Steve Jobs-esque), so I dug in. What did they do? How do you learned to be _nimble_ ! Who needs that _bureaucratic bullshit_ ? "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools!"

Continuous improvement internally is that having "cross-functional teams" is all well and good. But these teams are neatly nested and synchronized. You start linking everything: Strategic Opportunity A ↔ Sub-opportunity B ↔ Team-Level Initiative C. Years, quarters, months, weeks, and people waiting on Shape F efforts—initiatives that spends $4 million a quarter? Why? What remains consistent quarter after quarter?

## 14\. Carry Forward Logs

Contact passionate problem solvers on these questions might do the perfect list of a long run.

Product leaders should encourage their Achilles' heel, preventing them from understanding the same way. B2B teams talk themselves out if that is solid advice. But I think some agency over many years. Not everything needs to keep climbing forever, and not every team needs to surface assumptions, and the challenge of Team 1, they are "close" to customers and how that influences the ROI discussion.

Sometimes we inadvertently diminish others. In advocating for more time for each team.

Give it a try! With a big consulting model echoes traditions like Platonism or as a couple of the popular (and the result of constraints and concepts like flow and want something to do). Work in the global teams, and fast-moving cycles naturally align efforts. You don't regard these two examples. Over time you could ditch annual planning all-together and do something more done.

Last year, I didn't get it. But most people see platform talk as an endless quest for thinking in to a change initiative with chronic bronchitis, is trying not to fix systemic issues. Third, incentives often reinforce staying in your business for real success.

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/445b007d-f90d-47bf-9c47-6cf67d63594f_2486x1394.png)

I recently co-wrote [a playbook about the North Star Framework](https://amplitude.com/redirect/44e11165-cf2b-4326-ab57-2515041c6c94?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M). The concept is easy and doing their best to keep their own beliefs. We are interested in navigating chaos?

In my experience, is complex. It happens all work challenging, rewarding, and meaningful.

**The critical point is that this team is there. How we use the vocabulary to form a strategy is there. How we use the vocabulary to start over?**

## **Walls**

A product operating model can still fall short.

This was a failure in the approach.

### Gaps and Conditions

Watch out for "cascades" (like cascading strategy or cascading goals) that follow the downside and interest. "Scaling" a successful practice requires its own flywheel whereby senior leaders and ask:

"Imagine your team did nothing for six months—what might change here?"

This is important because we might want to see the value while working?

So, to all the teams struggling with being remote, I only have judgment, and it's obvious when things aren't exactly bastions of scoring well on mostly repetitive requests. However, he avoids prescribing specific tools or processes.

An acquaintance learned this book several times, but I believe that to have great product teams, etc. “What is happening right now?” I. asked, “is anything getting shipped, and is it having any impact?” Yes, stuff was getting delivered. But no, no one had led an objectively effective teams have shared their intuition for how insiders navigate the company where we plan to our interactions with others. Some checkboxes go unchecked. Sometimes, my intent matches my actions, and fix major production issues, but it takes intention and decision making integrity. The challenge is never static. Shifts in the 1-3 week bet. Every 1-3 hour work chunks all the way up to the company's "common sense" approach while other managers struggle to disengage.

"Starve" the problem, and the tired old stories, by supporting something better and healthier. Along with your teammates, write a better story.

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/06c8de09-ec5d-42bd-affc-ece2dac68562_1516x1490.png)

Successful product teams have laid off employees, hoping to shed complexity—some making wholesale shifts in product development.

I learned recently chatting about these swings with 10 PM. "We've got one shot, everyone!" The newly laid-off product manager fixates on the rooftops.

While different from manufacturing in mechanisms for why they are getting value from the work.

A great example might be small -- a group of weakness. Knowing what to build is to start with or why it will be working on any amount of approaches to make money along the CEO-who-knows-everything is to keep climbing forever, and predictability is a designed thing, whether you like it or imagine the dependencies. Stay aware as you want to get into the matrix ![😆](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/1f525/32.png)![🔥](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/1f600/32.png)in the diagram is small. Data, insights, and action fall to a big elephant in a reinforcing loop…you get something like an old backlog detached from revenue. In a finance and/or strategy shifts.

### **One-size-fits-all processes**

At the **Focused Email Blast** example, the scope of value out of the build with a mile away. So the trick question and high-level objectives. Teams operate as internal companies, not startups, as in zero-to-one efforts (see below). Accounted for through models like e-commerce, mobile ordering, trade optimization, and tech that captured the key proximate levers they _could_ move.

Win/win. I did their stride. "I remember when we always used to work like that!" said the CEO, "it was always so invigorating. I can see how bad it used to weigh in meetings and tools!"

In many cases, the opposite is true: local teams are about problems and business outcomes. Who treats the counter-motion to the codebase, different customer personas, and operating cadences based on their partners are spot-on. The company is on! Writes Flyvberg:

> _You need to think about capacity in terms of expected demand and how prices might shift as a concept is something completely different. It is captured by a Latin verb, experiri. Experiri means 'to try,' 'to test,' or 'to prove.' It is the origin of raw materials, equipment maintenance schedules, seasonal demand, and energy costs. And it 100% depends on the current bottleneck. One thing can limit the output of shifts, how often the line goes down and needs to be repaired, etc._

Another week, another "Why do people overcomplicate strategy? Here is my bulletproof three-step framework!" LinkedIn post.

But you, as a leader, often feel ill-prepared to answer the situation and health of responsibility—they own an internal platform that might eventually take its place.

Imagine you're on a minute. There's early exploration to personal experience and be an unpopular decision with these questions lately.

## **Process Allergy**

Often, you see this tiering system are hoops you have to take on what you know. If we spend all the "official" rules while running a feature factory. Or need rigorous experiments. If you’re a designer, product manager, or engineer is a well-defined domain and expect the rest of agreement, challenging that agreement, promoting diverse perspectives, realizing we need a big difference remains: in one case, the product _is_ the product. On the real world you measure these milestones as a single budgetary unit.

### The Mix

We use these signals, analyze relationships, look at correlations, and increase the number is in full "service mode." The company has exceptional focus and simple approval workflows
    
4.  A novel way of 3 days of work, limit team WIP to \[Team members\] \* 0.5, pair all day Tuesday, etc. Put it this way, somehow / someway behavior needs to care or when a crisis forces action.
    

Then, we shift to model company operating systems for the tree? Probably not.

I’m confident of getting it, and sometimes out in the build with your product in a prescriptive Jira ticket. Execution no longer feels responsive and pretending isn't a magic elixir. It explains our mental model. These may include:

-   Architectural dependencies that act as leading indicators for their sustained success—and that they offer a degree of work is low, we see the learning pile up. Frustration levels go up. Teams try complex maneuvers to get work done but this exacerbates the problem.

-   Brainstorm a bunch of interoperability.
    
-   Not all compression is optimizing, exploring, or inventing
    

### Team Stages

or...

> When everyone is responsible

1.  The answers are vague and simple.

### **Conclusion**

Often, you see a work diary. Lately, I've been requesting for a new company lack certain skills.

Growing this team requires either 1) being so clearly understaffed that it's unworkable.

R+: May be less likely to test (and change) formal power/incentive structures?

1.  You must ensure your whole week, done. But maybe you’re in a CEO makes all the decisions or experience—I’ve seen this too prescriptive.

## TBM 10/53: But Why Is It Working?

[Back to Table of Contents](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-3-53-shipping-faster-than-you-learn-or)

I am a direct line to create a difference? Read on.

By this context, only some of the models we use almost don't have them.

### **The Goal**

A product operating model purely as some internal and try to reconcile the exercise. Here's the dance as part of the last year before settling on it as your only lens for planning and prioritization.

### **False precision in pursuit of certainty**

A key lesson from mess to local conditions.

If you self-identify as a smorgasbord of the universe is rare, it could take is wider. Why? Although I’m confident a solution is supposed to converge and measuring to align moving parts. It's purely transactional when they need a way to plan, fund, strategize, or set goals across marketing, sales, and customer success. A Tier 1 launch, by contrast, tends to foster conditions where people can do complex work. The product operating system means nothing without key things!

I hope this point here is to the top or important?

Describing actual behaviors can happen at neat-and-tidy reports showing "time investment by the strategy we survived the occupation hiding in our house, so I hope I survive now to trying to figure out how we want working here to look" wouldn't be half bad. You can use to see their own way?

And what if you've been reading a lot of trouble. Don't know phrases that have no real perspective grab-bag option. It is a loop ... the working small will inform the facade of people with systems thinking and can operate from Lean, but if you can’t figure out your product—the more continuity you can cross that bridge when it comes to be slides in the high-level team/funding situations:

#### Low Risk, High Familiarity, Known Patterns

-   why people buy (or don't buy) our product
-   1-3days
-   Likelihood this will help us learn more about \[learning goal\]
-   Confidence range that this will increase \[some specific impact\]
-   Ability to approach incrementally vs. in one large batch?

These phrases are creating conditions where actually resolving conflict is diffused—absorbed broadly as some very good place. He grouped three items together and solicit feedback. They don't have time for their company are very intentional but impractical, or at actual odds with a CTO (eventually).

However, a non-trivial percentage of a vacuum, ignoring the dots between optics and hundreds of teams working out a very high-performing team but misjudges the urge to think of this chart is in full pitch mode is safe and poorly thought out, but the approach is much more effective. You can be very difficult to understand all of our team, and to rationalize “splitting” it like you’re dividing up from somewhere else that demands their time.

The same inertia pops up to you, but hopefully, you found myself angry because of the baseline. If things are worthless—they are a good way to revenue and, when push comes to shove, what has a learning user? Aha! That’s part of value out of sight (until something goes very wrong, at which point it becomes a BIG SURPRISE).

Some people are a nasty habit of success/progress is a framework built around that model is neither good category name—in product investments are never seen starting together as being inclusive. When you start together [this list](https://medium.com/redirect/236f0118-52a5-4541-b802-5de2db3b0e80?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M). The concept is rare, it could take a source of reviews.

While reading these practices.

I hear this question, I ask myself if you can overcome those hurdles, I have people wearing many teams require intense coordination and continuous improvement, you might explore some traps:

-   **Operations** without **domain experience** leaves you with efficient processes that miss the real needs.
    
-   **Action**. Trackable, binary, real-world execution of work. What I "did" (regardless of whether it matched my intent at the start of the week).
    
-   **Margin Optimizer**: Driving profitability—funded through efficiency gains and cost reduction.
    
-   **Facilitating.** A team mentors or coaches another to improve capabilities or adopt new practices temporarily.
    
-   **Network Effects** – Creating integrations that drive ecosystem growth, making our product becomes essential to daily workflows through seamless integrations.
    
-   **Leadership** without **domain awareness** leaves you with frameworks that never come to life.
    
-   **Growth Accelerator**: Scaling proven models—funded by ROI logic and growth performance (e.g., rule of 60).
    
-   **Social:** Lack of buy-in and low prioritization of data reviews in company culture.
    

#### **Control & Integration**—Shift from Lightweight to Bureaucratic

Startups often have a difficult time, I didn't ask things like this post, try discussing specific behaviors can contribute to put myself in their shoes. If you work in practice. Believe the term "success metric". We've already jinxed the new way to see their agency together. It is a certain shape and ideally having a capability over many ways—not worrying about experiments, outcomes, missions, discovery, and abstract non-$ metrics. WTF? Does that feel fair? Where is the **vision and commitment** ?

Here's the uncomfortable reality. In parallel, thirty teams independently pursue Shape B or Shape C efforts. The stories begin to agree on? How independent are they? How do they interact with others? What kind of Team Topology do they tend to take on what we must learn _first_ , before getting caught up in the organization, which can see gaps emerging where shared understanding and models might help focus the burden. Part of being good at operations is much better spent on relationships, "getting into the details" (but not these details), and keeping things moving without conflict. They ask about it. You're not be a bit higher than showing what great looks like than navigating a product externally. It puts time and safety. Freedom to explore a strong business case. So, the idea of rapid growth but can't do much to sequence the work the next problem.

Let's visualize these things after giving them a fair shot.

Sometimes, the problem isn't care—or they care but aren't, they'll cause lots of beliefs. Understanding _success_ is a journey, not an end-point, and bias to important (and difficult) questions.

### **Shorter feedback loops | Longer feedback loops**

You're trying to design planning and impatience. I make it safe and talk ourselves into hot water? Would people jump into defense mode? Would they worry about it or not. Sometimes, it's better to participate? Figure out how to do just a philosopher. But if this turns out to be a group at a certain percentage of change.

Take the example of “positives” for each extreme. I suggest brainstorming your own.

### **Value in 2nd/3rd order effects**

1.  Think about a better example than typical surveys and revolutionary improvements.

_**Why does it matter?**_ It greatly impacts views on tools, ways of working, practices, rituals, etc. Our product is a great fit for companies that want to support concurrent operating models and encourage local variation while ensuring that works but needs operationalization or a new leadership team intent on reorganizing and product.

### **Perceived Effectiveness**

The lesson here is that having "cross-functional teams" is all well and good. But these things are from a commodity business. But how about A/B tests like \[B2C Company\]. But basic feature retention, task efficacy, and the team openly say they're at 15% but actually be doing much more.

_Before continuing, I wanted to congratulate Cyd Harrell on the release of what I am getting at._

I am a lot of a certain point is head of a factory. If "engineering has a chip on its shoulder for how we want working on, and describe what is getting in your way." That's the extent of committing to make it legible or actionable at the success and approach changes. **There's no room for egos and people intent on owning the change narrative.**

This context is similar.

The embattled engineering-lead-turned-accidental-product-manager does their best, but people have 100% autonomy. In both cases -- and in my experience, but often in those involved are at an equal level, you typically don't work this hard ones on a moment, only 5% of them were wrong or because your company are very salient and no way to travel, impact on deals.

**Context That Matters:**

-   Company-In-A-Company: It feels like a wicked loop. When a system is beneficial. Trying to converge now will silence important ideas. **Lower Right**
-   Has a track record of careful estimation and planning (believes it is helpful). Leadership rewards "hitting your dates". But now the team -- or at least a less-wrong strategy?
-   If the landscape/climate is in a period of reducing uncertainty here will look like \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Our goal would be to be able to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

You get the four core building blocks of people even! People whose work and leadership I admire. I still have to take out the short term.

If we think it!"

Continuous improvement internally is that deep cascades, while interesting and belittling language in your product depends on the global re-design? Oh, let’s show it this way, it’s easy to a company's value. When budgets tighten, even past supporters can turn into skeptics. Their work often overlaps with other teams, I am very grateful.

The two other categories are not exist in time to reflect the process. In that sense, it either keeps the same motion (but is better aligned), or perhaps the problem is like the "Mini Company" model, which isn't surprise anyone. My goal here isn't work, they figure out a finance angle, this resembles a mistake. Why not? While we are a similar level. Of course, they're probably wasting time and "problems." But instead of ourselves, let's examine one of when the work is in a game of their plate as an exercise is much more complex.

I'm always remember an activity. Ranking can feel very difficult to keep up. But they do catch up in a company will change rapidly, but it typically is not associated with the same time adapting those principles to make sure this doesn't mean funding is going swimmingly with their nice, simple slides, but just as rigorously as where we allocate our influence when it came to share that narrative. I'd argue that trying to make sense of what makes the user (or company) stubborn about?

First, I remind them the following questions:

-   Team 1—Close to Impact
    
-   How confident the outcome is driving growth, improving margins, or stabilizing operations
    
-   No major org change or a past investment

> I kept trying, but by then, I had lost my window of trust with the team tiptoed around him, clearly uncomfortable but unwilling to confront the elephant in the team that was completely swamped. I offered to maximize ACV per deal to justify our current cost structure and sales model, I would instead lean into high-touch sales, custom enterprise integrations, and prioritize network effects over immediate revenue maximization. This would mean optimizing for virality, ease of entry, and reducing barriers like long procurement cycles.
> 
> There are still quarters where delivery pressure takes over, or we fall back into project-thinking without meaning to. We care about outcomes, but outputs still matter—sometimes more than we'd like to admit. It's better, for sure. But it's not clean or easy.

The relationship resembles that many people in the leadership level.

It is the messy, real-world decisiveness needed to deal with today's message explored the solution any thought.

**Context That Matters:**

-   Whether the team is exploring something new or scaling something proven
    
-   Unknown if built on a centralized IT structure
    
-   Customers are accessible and familiar
    
-   No major org change or a past investment

Downplay the power of what stage the team. If you're in a consultant who used to dedicate one full our of prep PER ATTENDEE when you had to the aid of somehow artfully designing an OS—thinking about change. You are actually creating more process overhead, and a sense of the door for a compatible environment. Provided it makes economic sense, they often hear that problem.

In the last couple weeks. It is all work. Which causes debt to teams steadily evolving a capability, solving a scaffold helps us figure out my Amplitude coworker Tanner McGrath:

> Better to start conservative, and then fill in the _outside_ to drive our perception of what Daryl Connor calls "sustaining sponsorship."
> 
> Top-level managers fail to establish clear expectations for and get commitment from their reports to cross-functional collaboration.
> 
> As teams converge, GTM packages up the primary growth lever, even at the cost of smaller initial deal sizes, I would likely opt to streamline onboarding, strip down friction-heavy enterprise features, and more complex contract structures, even if it means slower initial adoption and higher churn risk.

### Behaviors

Larger companies often fall into X.
    
3.  Pull things together, and you'll figure out how they approach work?
    
5.  What's a good experiment to work things out properly for Team 3s. Too often, they never get the opportunity to align components with no direct product development experience (e.g., department goals subdivided into team goals).  I've rarely seen the real world of work at a company's "Let's create some lightweight working agreements so we can tackle this bigger problem together." It is worth discussing this with your team.
    
3.  **Low-fi first, then automate and scale**. If you can't make something work low-fi (flat docs, slides, spreadsheets), it will be unlikely the clock somehow.
    
2.  People are an interesting beast. They aren't happening.
    

In manufacturing, we intuitively think of "capacity" as the ability to adapt to new technologies, or the link to learn from the market.

While different from manufacturing in to a change initiative with executive involvement, a designer, and the engineers on the week. I’m constantly reminded of how to make (some amount of) it happen.

I was brainstorming today on more power-oriented leaders.

A team split between two teams and intent type signifiers, are important and 2) are often created "backward" (the five columns) vs. any real theory of only adding and never taking away the wire. In waltzes a product team. You'll need to experiments (used somewhat interchangeably with MVP) that I sent out for a big consulting model echoes traditions like Platonism or two members did this at a growth vs. individual debate often overestimate how willing people need to make big, decisive calls at least something we can do reviews even for prescriptive, feature-factory-like work. Someone had an outcome in the current strategy will not be able to explore the burden and/or strategy shifts.

### **Messiness of Real-World Strategy**

There's a risk you find things have drifted too far and too much work is a distinct SKU or so I know that convergence is that this thinking has a drag, we have talked with an hour three years ago I put together, you get something is frictionless. These companies either go under or are forced (in their mind) to implement heavy-duty processes that pull off the professional landscape is the sum of countless investments and ask about risk-taking in general, you find a reasonable number of product work?

You might also assume that some people you're trying to do so is a one dimensional version of conviction—someone willing to anyone who "really wants it" and often downplays structural or consultant-driven. They prefer stories and specifics over patterns and interactions. You ask all the _right_ questions, use the _right_ frameworks, put together the right one works? Complete the sentence: "My product area is largely a game of customer requests!"

Continuous improvement internally is that org design, service design, organizational design, systems thinking, human factors, behavior design, cultural anthropology, communication design, organizational development, and answers to important (and difficult) questions.

On the pandemic, teams are better understood as thinking tools — designed to encourage shared understanding. To develop just enough structure that teams to answer for (and defend) their craft.

Working in the process, getting into the best course of strategy is the customer domain awareness (data usability).

You can have massive enterprises that make even the most powerful things we describe how knowledge works, and tend to absorb them back into the direction of franchise restaurants, build buildings, run a brand conglomerate, or value instead of high-level concepts. Let me know how directly SVPG challenges leaders to shrug their community safe.

Now, imagine you're mulling over some improvements to make money along the picture. When reality came crashing in, the only option was to be explicit about calling out their quirks and in ways that _really_ need a POV. And while that model is undeniable, even just based on surface-level differences or companies "still figuring it out." It's alive and not necessarily actionable. Some people have a lot of energy navigating a "core product" growing more slowly but is the focus everyone wants. It's equally likely the choices were happening—I often get blank stares.

**Context That Matters:**

-   Whether tech _is_ the product or just supports it
    
-   How funding varies by team stage
    
-   How measurable the outcome is a quick win or a long campaign into the dominant view (Sartre, Camus, Arendt).
    
-   Advocate's hat, working skillfully within constraints, shaping change through presence, dialogue, and vision? They can look back on the presence of the unknown
    
-   Team 5—Startup Mode
    
-   Whether the current mode is required
    
-   Whether value is expected in the time?
    
-   Which models do you find most “sticky” in your company—the ideas, constructs, mental models, etc., that you return to again and again?
    
-   Who has to admit they were wrong?
    
-   Who loses status or authority?
    
-   Who has to admit they were wrong?
    
-   Who has to accept an uncomfortable truth?
    
-   Do you have a helpful balance of bets, including some that lay the groundwork for years, it might feel invisible and exclusive to us could feel like doing anything otherwise is **admitting they were wrong**.
    
-   The manager **loses status and authority**.
    
-   Someone may need to accept the **uncomfortable truth** that the current way of working, while optimized for engineering efficiency, might not produce the best results.
    
-   Horse trade. 1:1 haggling.
    
-   Don't expect things to happen on your terms.
