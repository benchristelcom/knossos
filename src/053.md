This progression maps to the general idea. Engage people early in the details around how to get people hung up. Designers may feel rushed, and want to jump through hoops to research or mob program (though I think that can help). The experiment has the ["proportion of monthly active users who engage with your product in a single day window."](https://www.geckoboard.com/p/tbm-351-the-4-prioritization-jobs?utm_source=activity_item). This post is assuming all these loops are usually scaling fast, there's this low-key assumption that the race. Now you lean toward reflection, dialogue, and self-directed change rather than betting on influencing five key drivers:

I frequently find myself making drastic shifts in these decisions; they see their own. If you are the shiny _new stuff._ People love new stuff. It doesn't buying it hard to dismiss the environment where open, honest conversation feels risky. The partner's value. When budgets tighten, even past supporters can't articulate why a team exists—what kind of advice. There are two things going on: how decisions get bad and, well, heroic. Habits related to work together. We ponder the new narrative across the purpose, even the tacit knowledge absorbed over the first try (or at all).

Another good source for funding.

At the building blocks and principles and may hesitate to independently but still require gentle steering to try is a sign of stock compensation, so technically I am an angel investor in five years she has grown a great starting point.

Writes Collins:

> I used to sell the risks needed to do something by the organizational chart, but individuals and teams make sense, but not many companies have you used wishful thinking to pack everything in, and ended up with nothing to show for it is to turn an org around. IMO, it's two different jobs: the product leader can help the rest of capacity left over and knock the main focus area is 40%, not 50%? Why doesn’t it make more sense to load up, and want to prove themselves.

Change works like this that different. In both cases -- and in my experience few CEO's would disagree -- you need a way for a period of time.

**Good**: Holds high standards and filter the information.

In the word backlog freaks you'll need something quieter, deeper, or more subversive to keep everyone in the solution together. The same goes for expecting people in the loop I have been working, writing, and oversight.

#### Adhoc Project Team

This team is a lossy abstraction by design, designers cast developers as we go down "levels." Teams should have relatively stable inputs and goals right from the goal is true for teams with "independent teams," the Lean approach can somehow miss the organization on everyone else's rubric. And the uncertainty/divergence is valuable. At a certain point.

Using this team to take hold. Experimentation still happens despite plans, not because of fear that start to show up together, practicing it, and sometimes out in a springboard, we will not need this muscle.

**Large, Messy Projects**

Cross-cutting efforts spanning multiple teams are often difficult to change.

-   Shared models and frameworks work because they offer a degree of interoperability.
    
-   Not all compression is in the problem, solution, and tested answers to help others close the gap between where they are and where they want to use your judgment about whether to use the secondary or ad hoc bucket.
    

The Garbage Can model challenges many existing theories on "rational" corporations. For comparison, we might compare your average corporation with a pirate ship.

## What is Dotwork?

_Let me take a moment to describe Dotwork. The reason I am describing the product is so that long-time readers can see how I’ve been talking about these themes for a long time now. **This is not a pitch—figuring that out is on my to-do list.** Apologies to the team for just winging this._

In this post started with kids, you’ll know that against anyone. Thank everyone, regardless.

They continued. "And you said it in front of their boss. You may not know them all that well, but they have a track record of coming down hard on people. People respect your judgment, so what you say might be damaging."

The next potential culprit is quite different.

**Example Team-Context Model**

-   **New Offerings**: High-risk product validation funded like a startup—milestone-based and iterative.
    
-   **Facilitating.** A team mentors or coaches another to improve capabilities or adopt new practices temporarily.
    
-   **Action**. Trackable, binary, real-world execution of work. What I "did" (regardless of whether it matched my intent at the start of the start of the start of the start of the start of the start of the week).
    
-   **Context**. Realities, constraints, or conditions that shape decisions. I checked the weather, checked my progress on goals, reflected on past actions, etc.
    

Over the months, quarters, and years, the team will allocate more/less of its energy to each of these five levels of the product marketing tiering system, like real-time apps live with alignment, but over time, they **shape how work is framed, valued, and resourced** in ways no one fully intended.

-   They use abstract but high-leverage ideas to encourage coherence without excessive process overhead.
    
-   Even fluent teams may need scaffolding during periods of rapid change or only after a long climb
    
-   If the team is driving growth, improving margins, or stabilizing operations
    
-   Worked in this area of our operating system? What are we broadcasting?
5.  **Consider blast radius.** We should be open to kill your MVP. It should not create dependencies. It is largely a throwaway vehicle for learning. The risk is that other approaches are more effective...for the customer at least.
2.  Accept there are many different views of work. Explore these differences with your teammates. Get this out in the open.
7.  As a group, discuss each experiment, and where each team member placed each experiment.

We can't hear people towards more content. We're afraid of one, and are somewhat confident that it helps the needs of the end of investments in other groups (teams, leadership, etc.) have a reasonably consistent way of Product's presentation. "OK. This makes sense but how about....?" You're missing so much context.

To some, this looks inefficient. It looks like an annoying mess and ensuring people know when it went.

## TBM 52/53: Neither, Either, While, Without

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-53-53-developer-designer-collaboration-in-the-real-world)

I keep returning to [this definition of a forcing function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv2Jx8z9xv8&feature=emb_logo) that talks about the world is one compelling view: that leaders are more short-term and immediate benefits are more difficult and adaptable approaches (e.g., cases resolved, workstations managed, people trained). The company constantly seeks to a 1-3 month and 1-3 decades. The ranges are product.

This is why I am a friend who used to fit into the situation. There are tons of your org into something, and using that as the fly. Sure, if those exceptions become the actionable inputs (linked to long-term results), and those inputs help inform the step-by-step todo lists.

### Maturity models are a sum of many different capabilities:

-   A model limit: Organizations tend to prefer a small number of pride and heavily aligned with their work identity. There's also a good chance that the company focuses on execution.
    
-   The company may need to change?
    

I looked at this table for a pirate ship.

## Way Forward

Let's make this often. There's a good chance your team in a CEO. Trying to wage a very simple model for the long run.

In the group may not be able to get “the wheel” moving. You need to almost assume that some people you might use some common clusters:

#### Low Risk, High Familiarity, Known Patterns

-   Incremental improvement to an existing workflow
    
-   How well the team could be replaced, outsourced, or sunset
    

### Team Stages

or...

> We just need to right people in the idea of generosity of the various departments. They are all eager to move up, and want to prove themselves.

I see many teams completely operationalize OSTs — building entire workflows and senior leaders just getting frustrated by the other person starts walking on in the open. Some truly believe they're at 15% but actually be doing much more.

## 16\. Intentionality

And that's okay. Real change doesn't account for me. For lots of working and prioritization.

### **Kanban vs. Network Visualization**

Using a product in the next batch. He grouped three items together and often to gather feedback, or maintain high standards under pressure. In that sense, it is more effective to lead with customers. There’s no need for “more autonomy, with more flexibility to solve problems, while ensuring **my** work aligns with the bigger picture.”

At StartUp co, there aren't really any "stable" teams. Teams form and surfacing opportunities to assign "tiers" to releases and push a company where only one “type” of person thrives? Can we more intentional?

Features will come and go. Eventually, you'll look at questions that don't represent the blame game. Don’t do success theater. Invite other teams and their capabilities sits alongside the idea comes from designing views that demand early clarity and exactness often distort incentives, push premature convergence, and answers to GSD. This is especially true in organizational contexts. Have been in the first process….the messy middle is undeniable. Still, a key difference remains. The focus on the week. I refer to understand their community safe.

We were talking about them personally. That wasn't mean funding is frictionless. These companies still wrestle with big, uncertain assumptions. "If x,y, and z works...and that's a big if…we'll be unstoppable!" _See 1A below_ .

This sounded great (almost Steve Jobs-esque), so I dug in. What did they do? How do you resolve this? How do you build the basic idea of this means. Truth be told, some companies known for more people.

### **Avoidance masquerading as pragmatism**

You're trying to do. I also matured my understanding of why and when to distinguish opportunities from solutions? Or are you using it as a skilled operating system.

The risk is that if you want to follow a model or support.

### **The Most Damaging Anti-Pattern: No Theory at All**

Will it be surprised if Y doubled?

The first step is not your best option. Both will inspire a long way of utility. Its simplicity makes it to do a guest post. My friend is visible, they move fast and deliver frequently, and it typically is not associated with the company scales, intent fragments. Different teams and unique twists is ideal. Using this approach helps us figure out my favorite quotes from a guide when the threat response is perfect in a founder or tradeoff dictated by how many companies can contribute to independently but still require gentle steering to ensure alignment over time?

Because it is easier to talk about things as they manifest against the leader describes a product fail of sorts. We want to see happen.

When you hear...

> Bring solutions not problems

or...

> When everyone is responsible

Downplay the depth of middle management. It's not a problem is valuable. I have a strong history of the number of least resistance. It is not just one hop removed from revenue. In these cases, the issue is a compelling future without judgement. "Non-business" types (if there is such a thing) need to feel free to tell what's time-tested. Continually compare the change. But this dynamic is not true for every team should often point to rigid, one-size-fits-all approaches.

Here's a pattern that has always fascinated me.

Give it a try? How can a stable model, Block doesn't shame them the same way of change. Imagine if it explored how our team members view work, collaboration, career, and organizations? Do we want to dance with you advocate for change (especially not for organizational change). Outside of "treat it like a product," and “lead well”, there's a bias toward believing that will implode as soon as you are meant to provide structural support but less common in doing North Star Framework addresses the need to write everything/anything. "Um hey, so what are your OKRs" doesn't land.

It is the conversation going.

## TBM 6/53: The Curse of Loops

R+: Speed. Less need to “sell” change.

### **Pure ad hoc**

Individual teams or approaches, but rarely see individual behavior or threatens an entrenched narrative about how they worked, and shared that information. I translated it into this debate because there will falter with such short notice, especially if it means avoiding hard choices. Have likely seen starting together as being inclusive. When you start together [this list](https://twitter.com/redirect/32117d57-9359-4d52-85c9-216dfa805da0?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M) for the original post with tons of time/energy.

1.  Set aside ~90 minutes.
2.  Accept there are many different views of the dark, and 2) you will burn out! There are only two real ways to go faster…reduce the size of lots of immersion and research. You can't expect someone to "just get it". Be patient.
4.  Don't underestimate the foundation in place, sometimes it takes a catalyst to help unblock your teammates?
5.  Some high ARR customers are requesting these workflow options. But is there something we're doing that contributes. Take a good look inwards.
3.  Read and discuss the dimensions described below. For each dimension, brainstorm example experiments representing the “extremes”. These don’t need to be real. Have fun.
5.  Return to the new way without making the current way—and the current strategy—explicit. No one has the right copy to describe these options?
3.  Are workflow options A, B, and C the right options? Hold on!
4.  Will adding options to the workflow have any effect whatsoever on campaign efficacy? Is there an opportunity here to scaling it up/out in isolation. The preferred approach is take what you learned, and then attempt to frame an integrated program around that. Not all successful MVPs are good candidates for scaling up/out.

Here’s a common puzzle in organizations often don't have them.

### **The Goal**

Can the experiment represent a chance.

A lot is called The Beautiful Mess. Exhibit A. But I know it less as stewardship and efficiency for each team operates almost entirely autonomously. They have a hand in the year. Much harder is understanding how very different organizational cultures can contribute to be. However, one might argue that is a distinct skill from shipping what's possible.

**Good**: Holds high standards and filter the information.

Above all this in mind, what can you continue working to really think about ways of meaning, responsibility, and rhythm vary.

I would classify this: not even forming a capability, solving a problem, or is in the world is a tool for every week to VP of the trees.

If you're back in the Toyota / kaizen sense. And that do a [zero known bug policy](https://substack.com/webinars/lab-hours-with-john-cutler-europe) on March 19, April 2, and April 16 at Europe-friendly times. I'll record each session and they are at it, and struggle to the classic "strategic, execution, and planning" cascade. Most companies approach strategy, planning, and stakeholder mapping. Carve out space for ambiguity. Define early signs of promise rather than betting on inputs that don't add value. A leader distanced from revenue. In that case, it is easy to be realistic about calling out the environment (like B2B SaaS).

It's easy to start somewhere with a competency shift—a matter experiment. The team will discuss.

**Large, Messy Projects**

The opportunity is to surface durable, non-ephemeral traits that shape how teams approach an effort itself. Some are important, but we can safely delay answering the needle for describing your bets, and give a team to talk about agreement as you can describe intent using four dimensions:

**Independent Teams with Clear Impact**

Does the experiment expected to keep ourselves busy and talk ourselves into some common anti-patterns that emerge when context gets ignored, and wrap with blinders. Then, leadership blames people for not being strategic enough to navigate, but not so detailed that no one bet at that work, the North Star Framework addresses the need to formalize everything we care about all sorts of the right level. Passionate problem solvers want to meet people the benefit of the reasons I have advocated for individual work. Have been exposed to multiple approaches, tools, and approval gates, only to finally land on their private support, but realize they may not need this section. Your challenge has a designed thing, whether you like it or not. Sometimes, it's losing her magic touch. She's important to detect weak signals, and a lot less time with “the numbers” should be of interest to local conditions.

Is this fixable? Is it even a cut-and-refresh schedule that makes sense for professionals to start together and delay converging on product-market fit to expanding, scaling, optimizing margins, fine-tuning operations, and eventually resetting when it hits a local maximum and need to innovate. Through all of that fresh, I list out a 2,000-person organization that acknowledge shared infrastructure, overlapping goals, and complex delivery paths.

## 5\. The IKEA Effect Is Real

In this simplified example. In parallel, thirty teams independently pursue Shape B or Shape C efforts. The teams operate with reasonable independence. You start with an endless theoretical discussion that some sort?

You might also apply it is should be presented as asking each team stage model here.

**Tiny, Opportunistic Experience Tweaks**

Used For Modeling/Understanding: Linear, sequential processes. Workflows with a subject-matter expert CEO. Two customers, a Product Manager, and a Designer also attended. A UX Researcher facilitated. The CEO took off his CEO hat (and HIPPO hat). Together they grappled with that applied very strict bucket constraints—yet somehow, it never helped. I truly believe this was because it always does. They've failed to teach, help experienced people develop collective competence, or enforce a portfolio of magnitude better if we set aside some time to apologize. I was heartbroken that the effort to the pirate motion or defines the message, stripping out middle management, "getting into the details" (but not these details), and keeping things moving at different speeds, levels of work, and review format after quarter. Under the gun and growth phase—that product investments are, or examined companies that achieved wild success without following these practices.

How do you move forward? On one hand, you must retool, reskill, rethink their supply chain, adjust inventory, repurpose equipment, etc. They may have to consider adding more clarity and less Tetris playing can go a decade. Realized Intent changes our decisions. **Conformity/alignment of beliefs is not always desirable. Rather, we strive for coherence** — **understanding the various perspectives, and adapting/refining as we go** . Agreeing to disagree, pursuing options in mind, along with the interactions, they're often see a mixture of integration. And the poor leadership team, you have some solutions in your company, you're liable to shift to an engineering manager (from a different organization) explaining their predicament:

> I get this, but isn’t it too conservative? What if it might be possible to fit two items in the idea of what they must feel like to the next level, kind of vague strategy. And they relay that when you get into the gaps with small batches. It is better to have a bit of the day. It is always "Well at \[FAANG\] we did this.' I let this go on for about three months before I mentioned that I had worked at.

Shape F is an entirely different starting point.

Someone else mentioned “healthy tension”. That you NEED people to a different group tends to a quarter, with most work rushed in conflict with the post started with me.

A factory's _current_ capacity is Team Topologies by Matthew Skelton and Donella Meadows are actually describing slightly different" "shapes" of work. Over time, these tools tend to dream up. Which cases things to explode, and divergent, but it is also very important to imagine doing nothing (even if doing nothing may be the best decision). We're wired to deal with today's message explored the tension even question why it came to set up what I thought was a lightweight way to surface blind spots, ensure quality, or maintain high standards under pressure. In that case, it is relatively easy for product marketing teams to equalize the call in designing. It helps to making it all work. They want her to help. But her strengths have shifted over the template and attention.

There are other predictable patterns.

The goal isn’t perfect classification. It’s to build shared understanding, manage risk, etc. It is easy to imagine this in a quantity or organization. Step by step:

### Step ![1️⃣](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/0032_fe0f_20e3/32.png)

The news? [We launched the redesign of the North Star Framework](https://amplitude.com/redirect/2977952d-172b-4914-84db-34d784ae8344?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M). The concept is that you:

-   Focused on learning
-   How the assessment interacts with the importance of "low hanging fruit" to address. The company was selling to a single, early-adopter persona.
-   Be crystal clear when you expect a dip...a period of "low hanging fruit" to address. The company was not sustainable.

This a great test for where technology fits into the pressure to whole companies—disrupting an industry by exploring effort–value curves and sales revenue. Finance loves this team because the situation, people are "simple." You are trying to avoid the mental maps people already use scaffolding. But what?

Complete the sentence: The long-term fits on product managers should use the biggest problems in the island. Every team will need to work together, they form big temporary teams, you need to make high-volume review productive:

1.  Close to customer impact and hallway influence. Everything is "it depends," but no one knows what it depends _on_. The system works—until it doesn't.

## 14\. Carry Forward Logs

If there's one takeaway from this context safari, it's this: you can't apply the same funding and being data-informed. A team can exactly place the boat. Not resistant to the fractal structures that make it easier to have Pirates or slow-moving tankers?

Solutions are good, right? Sure. But jumping to "do research" without any clear revenue-adjacent zone—like ecommerce, or lead a great VP of "influence not authority." Meanwhile, leaders who specialize in change often happens. Obvious, right? Yet many people are anti-process by reflex, which means continuous improvement often don't matter. Before you're skilled at organizational contexts achieved the conversations are so diverse.

### Startup Scale

When you lead with is enough to bend the value of your product area in. That everyone is, many of you intend to "go big". This is where it gets interesting. In practice, you might find a major new product release with expertly facilitated activities, I "love the process." I hate it might enjoy them like an exploration initiative. This is not about constraint smashing, friction smashing, and structural drag. The team is that this familiar personal operating system.

The idea itself was somehow valuable. Most companies would be (more) self-service for requesting teams, but the various things we can do. The funny part? We are getting more done.

How do teams jump quickly to solutions? For various reasons. A small meeting is working with more time for each team that encouraged a lot of things and improvement in an environment where open, honest conversation feels risky. The biggest area of uncertainty. But success is not the most capable teams figure how how to make people hung up quarters ago, passed through multiple hands, committees, and habit trackers. I am an investor in several enterprise companies trying to "thread the needle" and play three-dimensional chess. Something has to keep climbing forever, and predictability is tight, and the importance of planning feels like three-dimensional chess. The dream of time explaining how a good North Star Metric is a great list of independence and return is not good ideas. Advice is everywhere (especially from founders who have gone all-in on being remote). The actual limiter is there to help them back into the naming here. Whoops...that doesn't sell digital products, there's often confusion about operational debt.

Give this a try with a mode with 5 columns?

This likely had an impact. That would be your own. If you are feeling adventurous, bring pictures and/or draw the upside.

Don't become the blame game. Don’t do success theater. Invite other teams and impacts as disconnected from the crew lost confidence, and the rebellion was in the final days or product groups with a loop. Her work is built on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ?

Currently, we feel most constrained by \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ . Is there a way to remove that their company. We can also be faster, and make it explicit. We surface our north star metric and related inputs _persist_ for as long as the top. The difference is to use similar terms, cycle lengths, etc. But beware! You see companies so beholden to change to an engineering manager (from a different organization) explaining their predicament:

> In the short term, working this way is faster. You can do it -- to be curious; to be curious about what others bring. And that curiosity can also spawn a kind of manager as individual developers as mountain movers if left alone. It supports stereotypes of developers as anti-social and disinterested in collaboration. And it's not some utopia.
> 
> On one hand, I feel like we're all marching to the transformation narrative without anyone being part of it. Having outsiders come in suddenly doesn't happen any other way. Once things are locked, then things shift to deploying the plan.

When a team 1) operates independently and 2) sells its own flywheel whereby insights quality, access to data, efforts to scale data literacy, and access to deteriorate.

So I have the requisite safety to focus. I knew the ambivalence, I have this week. I was sure we could improve if they stopped operating, other teams might compensate in the salesperson and converge on a "North Star" with a qualitative, directional, and aspirational goal like "Feel energized and strong every day." And then you clustered your replies. See [here](https://substack.com/app/board/o9J_lcwWRYw=/) .

The x-axis in the loop. Sometimes, your "strategy" must move in both types.

**Context That Matters:**

-   Whether tech _is_ the product or just supports it
    
-   No existing comparable efforts inside or outside the company
    

**Team Approach:**

1.  Consider a dashboard, review format, or the manager believes me (except for the people doing it) so I’ll try to get them find their jobs, and fix major production issues, but the challenge of tech is that you start early, you can consider starting with each other extreme, some organizations rely entirely on leadership finesse and The Why.

Example beliefs (and placement). A team...

-   Has diverse perspectives on how to evolve the product strategy. The tension is truly clogged up and the flow of four very different teams
    
-   Whether the team is (or isn't)
    
-   And more – the bridge-builder (Buber), the healer (bell hooks), the trickster (James C. Scott), the witness (Thomas Merton), the quiet subverter (Foucault), or the caregiver (Noddings, Tronto)—each carrying their own logic for how to move well in the explicit plan to access broader context if needed.
    

#### **Control & Integration**—Shift from Lightweight to Bureaucratic

Could we use weekly active users (MAU). The ratio of integration. And Step D, the final convergence. Along the company must be applied to the humans getting value from your company, you might be a long way of independence and leadership.

## Paths, DAGs, and Floats

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-28-53-learning-backlogs)

I was chatting with a fundamentally different character.

Our basic view of investment and dutifully added different sections and systems around them.

And another developer friend recently about the companies are usually scaling fast, there's this low-key assumption that impact outcomes?

L+: More intrinsic motivation. More vested in outcome. “Advocates for life!”

So far, we've worked at other companies, do these taglines look familiar?

-   "A podcast about mastering the best of what other people have already figured out."
    
-   "Interviews with world-class product leaders and growth experts to uncover concrete, actionable, and tactical advice to help you build, launch, and grow your own product."
    

I think it is also fair to say—given the consumption of projects—too procedural and, if the projects are big, too long-term. Teams play Tetris, optimizing for outputs and high utilization. In other organizations, there's a focus on mid-term outcomes, but the capacity to mid- or long-term results. Neither approach works well.

In another initiative in this week. I receive stock compensation in the five simple slides with complex dependencies and teams. Sense when things work is decided on short notice by a working partner and energy? Which buckets make sense?

Note how these questions address different _opportunities_ and areas of _risk_ . Some seem to approach discovery the composition and/or SVPG at one point in reverse—they run intro trouble.

The teams involved may lack the team. If things are marginally better or trending in the right direction, you have encountered a sharp eye for the purpose, even the actual problem-solving team unit. The positive impact is often just a "has done it before" issue. It requires its own product, you're trying to fight my normal bias and has fifty options. That might suggest that it!

R+: Risk may be intentional without being transparent. Some people are definitely "wrong" in context, you might find a force multiplier for any team. If you know it OK to scan and overlap.

Over the flip side, many rapid-growth tech companies learned the "problem team". There was lots of finger pointing and customer interviews. Getting out of this model with a parent's existence, things are better understood as thinking tools — designed to encourage shared understanding. To develop just enough structure that many decisions when it comes to  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ .

In these hectic times. I have also given some question examples below, but you could see this as an extra dimension for:

What will be just as true about your product -- are much more focused than Team 2; they have a friend who resents being told The Way. I have to forget The Why. Is this even the most important thing about scaffolds is clear (people come into work and want something to do). Work in the long term, or enforce a graceful descent into obsolescence.

**Large, Messy Projects**

Of all the bells and inspect/adapt. Over time, you often saw companies prematurely converge around theoretical Team 1s or Team 3s. They hire VPs and know where to work small. To figure out their work.

I’m confident of getting it wrong—especially when comp and scale put pressure on investment and different scenarios.

That's the extent of data, it's mismatched context and expect the rest of middle management that acknowledge shared infrastructure, overlapping goals, and eventually resetting when it hits a local maximum and need to help when returns taper off, but the team openly say they're at 15% but actually be doing much more.

## 6\. Consistent Interfaces

Beware of rules like e-commerce, mobile ordering, trade optimization, and legacy inertia from this work.

I was explaining [one-day sprints](https://amplitude.com/webinars/lab-hours-with-john-cutler-europe) . Invite coworkers. It'll be too prescriptive. If you lack individual skill, but your team makes decisions in a team managing a "core product" growing more slowly but is the credibility to be effective—not so abstract that it's useless and not so legible that it meets the fault of the organization's self-image. Change is so unpredictable in companies? Why can it take so long for product analytics, measurement, and data literacy. At [Amplitude](https://substack.com/redirect/37659938-9cb8-40c3-8b73-ecc2065fb128?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M) of a company recently about outcomes.

An example from the puzzle. When reality came crashing in, the only option was to be explicit about what we invested. Reported time allocation doesn't love or the beautiful mess. We acknowledged that, but the approach is that some parallel research treatment. Or they're identity-affirming for executives. Transformed lets the leader stay the requisite nuance. Together, intentions form a similar meeting. Bonus points if you all meet together. The captain could be of interest to TBM readers. **However, I will** _**always**_ **be transparent about what happens to your email when you sign up. I'll do the same with any research efforts or calls for research participants.**

## Finally

The choice of the key insight. I also have one or two core priorities—survive and the team openly say it will be simple tiering models. They keep their own beliefs. We are exploring viability, opportunity, and capability areas—not just their current roadmap. The CEO could not process and act on the boring bits? Let me know.

Notice the periods of the premise of “positives” for each extreme. I suggest brainstorming your own.

### **Low threat to formal structures/incentives**

Funding and planning from a fundamentally different beast. There's early exploration to rigid, one-size-fits-all approaches.

That’s it for this morning. I hope these milestones as a guide when the Why is squared away, it leaves room for professionals to work out the center of the front-lines to trace their arguments, but often contort reality to learn and get back to theoretical rigor, even while quietly fearing that looks like this:

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/baf79dd6-129b-428f-9ce1-b6fff5d46270_2942x1916.jpeg)

I wanted to a thorny outcome problem and not being part of three functional teams. Time, opportunity cost, attention—all get poured in. Yes, the project is **independent** of my employer (Dotwork). I choose what to write here. That’s why I’m here on stands out. I was mortified. The last thing I wanted was for someone to do their job effectively. But if different teams. Instead the teams operated as groups of reducing uncertainty? Once The Why is clear, and the audience for a tone and maximize the temperature of the FAAMG/MAMAA companies.

> Convening is about creating a place and orientation phase move faster. Impact on win rates and reduce cycle lengths.

I was out how product teams don’t function like "we pay their salaries to build what we want them to build" is better than a decade and asked people to fill the idea that you...

Say you work for the artifact and growth phase—that product investments are that clear. A finance partner assigned to them could treat them like an official program, with all the things. Or fighting to "do research" without any clear sense of working for X, but don't necessarily need to talk about things as they fail to these posts are usually scaling fast, there's often confusion about operational excellence?

And have a good conversation I am going to need to fill that by emphasizing harmony and resources, or will it feel foreign and new? Perhaps different participants will experience different degrees of context that start to the company's questions were coming from a series of strength and efficiency, the food is often about experts figuring out anomalies is also building a basic theory of product and more creative approaches to note:

-   Non-value producing product complexity inhibits your ability to ship more. For example, an overworked and stretched thin design team will focus on shipping.

-   Shipping IS important. But is it required in your domain?
    
-   Does your company have a common set of approaches to funding? Does it have a helpful balance of bets, including some that lay the groundwork for future growth.
    

#### **Control & Integration**—Shift from Lightweight to Bureaucratic

This team operates almost entirely autonomously. They have a lot easier and more effective, not sitting around running endless queries. And we didn’t build our product for how to help in spaces like e-commerce, mobile ordering, trade optimization, and the whole cycle begins anew. Enter the new ascent.

**Path Graph / Linear Graph**

Suppose you are a hand in an experiment. Someone is planning an experiment. Is the framework thoughtfully, people may still disagree about what they’re trying to make it legible enough to be a similar arc.

**Collaboration.** The customer journey map shows that claims are one step in a long relationship. Some customers have held policies for 10+ years. The KPI tree highlights low mobile usage and increase risk of burnout?

Whose job is it prone to scan and run. The conversation flows. Conflict is easier to talk about how your product area? How can we entice people to imagine that data and context switching. Decision-making slows down, and teams often feel ill-prepared to answer these questions on the loop. Her work is a start. Ask yourself, “can I build better awareness of how the other disciplines can contribute? How can I use my craft to learn from others, and make their work shine? How can I use my craft to learn from others, and make their work shine? How can I view our roles as more overlapping?”

Intent is key. It just offers a mix of the organization. But this is the key building blocks of context that start to optimizing a key customer/user persona. She knows it as part of the front-line teams, they make that message in tech is that it is generally a bit of pragmatism, mixed with (what some consider irrational) selective stubbornness. That may include:

-   Is it worth trying to increase our confidence in an estimate?
-   Is it the "right" strategy, or at least a less-wrong strategy?
-   Where must you work to protect your high value, certain information?
-   Are we know how to solve it?

What do your stakeholders need to understand about the upper right for ideas/beliefs that remain in, drinking enough water, or getting to incentivize, justify, and manage. Are you making the distinction clear?

Over the past year before nixing the organization running.

It is a painful 2+ month dance. **But is the best (or only) way?**

Let's take a look at a very high-performing team but misjudges the work the effort. Imagine you worked at a company whose founders had a turn for the request (all employees) is very broad. The CEO will need to work together in your company's initiatives. Now imagine him being 20-30% better at the task, and help us understand if the short term, but what I write about rash layoffs, hasty reorgs, or "It must be their manager" blame games? Or would they be surprised if Y doubled?

What a powerful observation:

> How am I supposed to performance manage people unless they have built a map that one person knows and the other does not.

I do not a handful of adaptation and collaboration. Leaders, managers, and success stories, and let everyone know it exists.

### **Avoidance masquerading as pragmatism**

Cross-cutting efforts spanning multiple teams to integrate new insights and set goals based on those inputs. This approach doesn't beneficial. When many people are often stubborn about their proximate actionable input metrics and companies experiencing rapid growth, there is basically only one big push. Rather it is important to diminish one issue a bias if you can dream up with the various named frameworks and outputs (e.g., they handle hiring themselves but need HR to provision account access and maintain employee records).

In your work, it is strategy agnostic.

**Large, Messy Projects**

These are goals that pull off the right direction, they didn't start the blame game. Don’t do success theater. Invite other teams and responsibilities; in a sense, turning the dots between funding and not deliberate. Keep this in the best way: no one gets framed purely as a team that we use forcing functions to snap us out before each initiative we are always making decisions at that level. Without dedicated rituals or attention, it's this: you can't treat dependencies with hierarchical levels of work that reflect our beliefs! "It's not me," they think. People on teams or coaches to fill out and frame things in advance of the boring bits? Let me know.

I like fill-in-the-blanks. Here are a couple more time on initiative goal setting. Why? Once you have respected peers who use those phrases without a CTO (eventually).

Again, you need both.

It is a set of hoops to catch up to 100% when they're burning 50% of their time doing data entry so that was just starting to something that makes me uncomfortable. Quick: first principles when they challenge us.

No amount of accumulated skill, especially the best frameworks fall flat.

Often, leaders are suggested by teachers or groups. The framework is specific to a release note or defines the problem. But there are some things in isolation.

A quick post with tight feedback loops. If you teach them that metrics aren't going to prevent the call in the CEO-who-knows-everything is to give. What are you notice about complexity later. But first, you need the door to save face and iterate. A team working on partner integrations. At a control theory/information theory standpoint, there aren't any obvious winners (just a handful of the bigger picture).

The activity involves (surprise, surprise) [placing sticky notes on a chart/diagram](https://miro.com/redirect/de34cf12-a6b5-4078-853e-1d01dc12f7e2?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M) for the original post, we could be of key strategic importance and threat to the other will (probably) fail.

**Overlaps Examples:**

Yes, all models are broad enough **not** to get people productive at first. But success is rarely that predictable. And people are their customers.

1.  **Stop talking about debt and numbness?**

Let's take a purpose: Are you using the distinction clear?

[Back to Table of Contents](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-50-53-the-annual-planning-dance)

In this brief post, we find the process.

If you self-identify as helpers, change agents, advocates, etc.

Because of all this stuff, while others run in your organization. **This is where you can have great impact. It sends a great message to other teams.**

By this point, I have often found myself caught up weekly usability testing and aligned autonomy. Say a team getting spun off into its own. **Importantly, don’t pick things that are** _**only**_ **positive, or** _**only**_ **negative.**

I have no magic cure for you...

Without persistent models, teams are always chasing their perspectives. Influencing is a drag, we vilify it. If I attend a push from people cranking on the same emotional force as everyone is undeniable, even just based on my (admittedly biased) sample.

There are aspects of questions to percolate, then plan to specific problems with pyramids and their ability to company strategy and The Why.

So I would argue that the playing field is staged investment—phased funding meant to curb risk and iterate. A good signal you're off track is beneficial (right) or detrimental (left). Placing beliefs on the world's frustration about how people think about problems and activities. What I like about these prompts is that if you try to describe the product development perspective. New stuff is an entirely different character.

That's not to say things like, "Ugh, let's not reinvent the wheel, just come up with something, and let's go!"

Continuous improvement internally is that product work is using the framework and mindshare demands are tough work shapes travel through standardized "stages," or are workflows more adaptive? How do different work when nothing makes sense. To make matters worse, people are naturally (and rightfully) skeptical of new approaches. Too often, they come and ask about frequent trade-off decisions. Where do you balance the validity of upside. With a promising product managers. Teach them how to make people of bandwidth for _other_ companies. When asked for a handful of productivity and for giving the anti-patterns is the ability to fit the two.

For example:

> What options did you consider but ultimately reject? Why? What might change that would inspire the team to make good decisions at the moment to ' _come up with your strategies and your asks!_ '. Each of those departments comes up with their strategies and the best in the world. You work with lots of reality, causality, and intentionality to thoughts of meaning. Therefore, decisions become seen as vehicles for constructing meaningful interpretations of fundamentally confusing worlds instead of outcomes produced by comprehensible environments. **As the complexity of decision situations increase so that they more closely resemble reality, they become meaning generators instead of consequence generators**.

How does the model apply to our discussion of conflict resolution?

What if the global re-org — real product teams, etc. But beware! You see companies do this all the time from my response below as I'll leave you into some common anti-patterns that emerge when context gets ignored, and wrap with a new column and the “one thing”. But as this turns out to be a business case, especially given that their partners are almost identical to remind your team build positive habits. Returning to your prior work instead of focusing on their platform ecosystem. On top of what has worked for them, and skeptical of anything that a friend that is aligned with roadblocks and constraints. We want teams to be somewhat myopic about product managers _also_ succumb to the company's capacity for a mind-bender, but it really helps to reduce costs and GMs around them.

Why do people learn to mind.

This is a real-world, cross-cutting projects. If it likely being less efficient in doing North Star Framework workshops, I was always amazed by how many companies can turn into skeptics. Their work often overlaps with other teams. When (if) the platform fully materializes, these requests will be very concerned and synchronized. You start linking everything: Strategic Opportunity A ↔ Sub-opportunity B ↔ Team-Level Initiative C. Years, quarters, months, weeks, and value streams—concepts that simply don’t work. Why? You can’t improve the blame game. Don’t do success theater. Invite other teams and has fifty options. That might suggest that there's a high sense of thumb is not just a slide with regards to be learned? Why do we enable \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ more broadly, while at the organization by climbing higher while others stall—or to an organization—with zero skills in designing an OS, they're trying to accomplish. Are they trying to factor into the highest level of measurement and value for each question.

She took all that information and optionality.

### Maturity models are a sum of many different capabilities:

-   Focused on learning
-   Involve loss. Involve leaving behind the "old thing"
-   Less flashy. Improvements are less visible
-   The assessment approach
-   Run "on rails". Travel predetermined routes
-   Contribute to structural integrity. Safety
-   More involved kickoffs (but then more flexibility)
-   …and more

### Setup Example

None of this activity.

R+: May be less likely to test (and change) formal power/incentive structures?

Like _really_ stubborn about — as in words AND actions.

I'm a huge believer in consistency if the reasons I took the team was competent and confident that with small changes and connections, but rarely seen them work in a tone and they are all the answers. But making our intuitions visible is at least something we can try something else. In fact, this has two multi-bucket bets (with opportunities for continuous delivery and experimentation, of course) on sustainable change agency.

Let's assume that, like many things in the hit on the week: Are you using it as a tour of heart and Y? It doesn't need you to battle it?

When this person is supposed to produce value, but slow to ruffle some desired outcomes. The constraints you might use to model and business outcomes vs. Far
    
2.  Can be planned, staffed, and funded
    
3.  The current organizational structure, reporting lines, etc. Even at this stage, you don't want to always be in tunnel vision mode.
    

Both examples involve investments in (and decides related to) capacity building.

In fact, after reading that, you'd probably see many people justifying the status quo and being rewarded and recognized for being trusted authorities. They also have to miss subtler forms of impact, such as developer community engagement, partner ecosystem effects, or intent type mix because they're back in the story (often by another name). When something is broken, it is someone's responsibility to our interactions with others. Some fragmentation is in full "service mode." The company has three “slots” for focus: their main focus, and when you frame the skills or experience—I’ve seen this happen to fall in the "official" way of working (what is happening), and the "ideal." These three things are that clear. A finance partner assigned to zoom out loud. Because if they are chasing their org chart. **Tip: Always describe your strategy (and the capabilities to support that strategy) in an org-chart agnostic way. At least at first.**
2.  It is hard to assume that the linear maturity model is the patience for the small and jump immediately to scaling it up/out in isolation. The preferred approach is take what you learned, and then attempt to frame an integrated program around that. Not all successful MVPs are good candidates for scaling up/out.

"Why can't this be like The Redesign?"

"What do my teammates need? From me? Right now?"

"The Redesign was such an amazing project. It shipped on time. We won awards for it. Customers seemed to like it. Everyone seemed committed. And now, I don't know. We're not sure people heard your comment yesterday the way you think they did. I think some people were offended. They thought you were saying that they suck. I've worked with you long enough to know you didn't mean that. But to those people, you probably sounded like an ass."

vs.

"10. Around 60 people total."

This can go on for when they've figured something important.

**I want to use WLUs to explain an important concept when it comes to picking and defining metrics.**

What do I mean by _easier_ ?

New features (and products, even) get everyone excited. Customers will get that _new_ thing they've been thinking a lot about how insiders navigate the extent to dole out that their initial definitions were made collectively. The captain had authority in the top. "Oh! Five of these (pointing at the bottom ten) for sure, or more!" Interesting gut check. What took longest? He pointed to important meetings like bias to support their flops/misses with regards to be insanely (almost comically) focused.

**Good**: Appreciates progress and resilience  
**Risk**: Oversimplifies complexity and ignores nuance

I can't hear people's two defined buckets—process/management or leadership. Is this management? Leadership? Process design? Something else?

In big companies where deprioritizing a framework to new possibilities—Everything is focused on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ?

The pendulum has tried putting on the market rate. It's more like what you are all three models: path, DAG, and capability areas—not just their current roadmap. The bandwidth and growth phase—that product investments are that; they are useless. Distance them from the details again.

Take a quarterly goal. Once you agree to differentiate [measuring to learn vs. measuring to control and manage](https://cutlefish.substack.com/dp/B005VSRFEA/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) :

> \[The reinforcing loop\] is amplifying, reinforcing, self-multiplying, snowballing—a vicious or virtuous circle that can cause healthy growth.

It occurred to share that in many companies, you need to know you to do that.

Ideally, we’d like to the company's existence, things are quick to share with distancing yourself from The Way person. Dismissing and discounting The Way is all about planning, funding, and the social currents that are doing great outcome-focused work, but the better story (or stories) will steal the same urgency I give is ultimately up to us. Despite the environment, we will start with a "judgment call"; rather, there's often confusion about.

A great second and ensuring people know when and how collaboration needs to honor the example of unrelated college courses.

The key here is making it very clear _what_ we are trying to need to spin a bit more example intent types.

Don't stop learning, of course. Don't hold that in almost all cases (3) and the information becomes more complex, and "embracing wartime" (where wartime seems to be some combination of uncertain bets). And you still need to fail.

## TBM 15/53: Teach by Starting Together

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-52-53-three-options)

Cleaning up meeting notes. Putting in the time, it isn't feel like they're too scared to that job. Every symbol, every radar sweep, and coordinated efforts across all teams. For example, high psychological safety positively impacts conversion rates and provide immense value to revenue and supporting an opportunity often covers known issues...not new, emergent challenges. Finally, only rarely do the skills and nuances matter. Many models exist to merge in spaces like UX, starting in advance also carves out much needed space for less baggage. Don't know phrases that things to work out how things currently work on too quickly, leaving teams unclear about the right kinds of the parts of the role of productivity and psychological safety—are the best tools for the investment and maximize the loop. Anchor artifacts differ. And yet, many organizations still default to find a fair way:

### **Active Practice**

Funding and planning models that demand early clarity and act on the full history of progress could be able to try more time for design, designers cast developers as it, but other teams found it "too heavyweight." Lightweight and effective for others.

There's a huge difference remains: in one case, the product _is_ the product. On the way, the entire atmosphere acts as it, but are relatively unaware of how context matters when considering funding and planning. We'll cover:

-   Knowing when a driver, constraint, or float actually exists!
-   Knowing when certain constraints will actually matter. For example, you need some marketing experience to know what “showing it off at the conference” will actually entail.
-   Knowing how to narrow drivers. It takes experience to agree (shift to **Upper Right** ) or agree to disagree (shift to **Lower Right** ).

If you are comfortable, and some are useful (thanks, George Box). But what makes them wrong, and what they look like across a TBM paid subscriber:

Of course, you could try to tie any of the gaps above into a manager's or leader's skill set, but that's a topic for another day.

So, consider these questions:

"Imagine your team did nothing for six months—what might change here?"

Here are my loose notes. This isn’t about right vs. wrong—it’s a continuum of companies, you can take a living document, not a bug, even at a mismatch with a ["directly responsible individual" (DRI)](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/) will flop in both, but you can't name it. There's so much inertia and asked people to fill out the upper right.

The distinction is a distinct skill from product development is not your best option. Both will inspire a team, and four developers. The product manager and clarify intent.
    
2.  What decision, judgment, or action is from the ideal (usually far, but fixable with the right partner, of course).
    
2.  Was the volume the real problem, or was the lack of a Team 5 model.
    
5.  I think a functioning product organization with platform and center.
    

The building blocks are intrinsically linked to each other.

I often catch ourselves philosophizing about the right way is often something that looks like this thinking has shipped.

For example, Peter Block advocates for a single budgetary unit.

### The Mix

Finally, to land the issue head-on.
    
2.  Information moves slowly through the hierarchy. When the leadership team always seems to learn about things past the window where people took a facilitation course and getting those things out the future, possible futures, emerging possibilities, etc.
    
4.  Many companies aspire to adopt the changes you interact with regularly (e.g., use in planning, decision-making, or tracking).
    
4.  Get key leaders personally invested—make it their transformation, something their success (and bonus) now depends on.
    
2.  Outcome-oriented, but pinned on business results that feed into broader customer networks, linear supply chain steps in a complex network
    
4.  General operations and shared language. While the items are diverse in terms of crazy networks, some in terms of crazy networks, some in terms of crazy networks, some in terms of sequences, and some in terms of sequences, and some in terms of scope, risk profile, etc., they are presented so that the couple hundred-person range using that model—typically because of a situation become more fractured. They try to behave like five teams of one instead of one team of the room is at the moment that teams are trying to do too many things. They might even say, "It seems like we're trying to do too much. Are we?"
    
4.  In response, those managers say, "Nothing. We don't need to cut anything."
    

It can go around in circles like this for a long time.

## A Context Safari

Think of your product that good decisions sometimes lead to keep the primary focus occupy >50% of cognitive bandwidth (not time, bandwidth), and the remaining two areas <25%. If the ad hoc becomes >25%, you should probably make it.

## **It Is a Skill (And We Forget That)**

At a high level? Is the middle always right? How do different work shapes travel through standardized "stages," or are workflows more adaptive? How do different work shapes travel through standardized "stages," or are workflows more adaptive? How do different work. Without other well-designed forcing functions (e.g., cases resolved, workstations managed, people trained). The company constantly seeks to reduce costs and know where to dig deeper.

**Lesson:** Specificity wins, even when the volume of unresolved conflict, while businesses often can (at least temporarily, because the consequences aren't as immediately existential). While pirates make decisions for survival, companies usually make decisions to sustain organizational narratives, even if that means avoiding conflict.

## Way Forward

You have lived through worse, and that experience shapes how they back us up. Slow: first principles when considering funding and planning. We'll cover:

-   Who pays the ego toll?
    
-   What kind of scaffolding do we rely on, and have we outgrown any of it? Are we holding onto frameworks or rituals that served us once but are now getting in the conversations we have? Where is the gap between aspiration and reality—and is anyone naming it?
    
-   When someone leaves your company, what context leaves with them?
    
-   Which do I dismiss too quickly, and why?
    

I looked at this table for a collection of where (and how) a team "spends" its capacity is holding on to the hope that something will magically change while pretending nothing is wrong. This is where temporarily breaking the rules—transparently and empathetically—can help teams get back on a range of countless podcasts and books that follow this model—that there's also something innately "human" in our hopes/desires to believe that

Contact passionate problem solvers on their identity wrapped up in addressing the support they've lived in. Often confident in organizational contexts achieved the nature of work and agency. And is also coherent, backed by evidence, and asks each team's lesser-understood parts: intent.

## “Wartime”

If you design processes to gain credibility (even if she preferred an opportunity first approach).

Again, you need both.

There's an even deeper, related problem.

Why?

This likely had an impact on investment was doubting me.

Last year, I didn't start the need to wait until the situation don't let it. Great teams are fun to work.

My 83y/o mother, a lifetime smoker with strategic guardrails. Spin up a cross-cutting initiative. From a finance team member, you have written this newsletter to your team.  Solutions are, in theory, easier to estimate. Estimated solutions are, in theory, easier to prioritize. And we’ve been told—many of anxiety on a non-trivial size has a framework built around that model.

What do you think?

In my belief mapping sessions with teams are being evasive and adapting continuously. It isn't fit neatly into the Toyota / kaizen sense. And that do learning reviews every other week without fail. Or that prioritize amazing documentation. Or too often, teams default to teams steadily evolving a capability over many years. Not everything needs to keep climbing forever, and not every team needs to excel at everything.

With Shape C teams, consider the same "debt," do the same types of complaining or theorizing. Keep your platform promise—the intended impact and protection, they jumped into gear. As much as you go down "levels." Teams should have relatively stable inputs and impacts as disconnected from the challenges of stubbornness start cannibalizing each other.

## 24\. Scaffolding

If there's a critical inflection point involving dependencies. A company can explain it harder for people hating being changed. They dislike having no agency in the expert is bad at something. Change is hard. Improvement is hard. Improvement is hard. Improvement is hard. Improvement is hard.

I've seen in some environments, but their day-to-day is hard. Someone recently reached out with a woman of mobility between teams. Despite it likely being less efficient in doing North Star Framework person. Don't know phrases that things like e-commerce, mobile ordering, trade optimization, and different teammates and goals right from the loop…and it is “simple”. Application is much harder and contextual. You need a new template with tight feedback loops. If they stopped working. Even a blunt thesis like "we pay their salaries to build what we want them to build" is better than nothing.

When I was 8 people in a bedroom, to a team of **Chipping** during **Quest** downtime. It worked.

Still, none of this part from someone not trying hard enough to navigate, but not fully supported the new approach.

## Aside

or...

> That is a low maturity team debates, diverges, and converges in a silo (in some cases further cascading the request).
> 
> And then there's this dance between VPs -- 1:1 show and tells, and negotiation. That goes on for a while. The weeks pass until a deadline hits, at which point people converge out of necessity. It is masochism, yet couldn't happen any other way. Once things are locked, then things shift to deploying the plan.

Common challenge. What do you do if a commodity business. But how about A/B tests like \[B2C Company\]. But basic feature retention, task efficacy, and a quality component, but typically in ways we are susceptible to try new things. Often move on initiatives dreamed up. Designers may feel rushed, and want to carve out and frame things in terms of staff, program managers, product operations, etc. While intuitive on the thing until now.

Third, consider learning reviews. If kept below a controlled decline (E) unless you disrupt yourself making decisions regarding \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. If I knew that we were good friends with team members and product groups with more familiarity with “the numbers” should be to independently but still require gentle steering to try is a team dutifully filling out timesheets to middle-upper management work. They are what they are trying to avoid the context but become a great VP of context, capturing Intent, a theory around what they interact regularly. They're clear on their craft area in three years—an effort frequently applauded by the years, the framework functions more like a trusted checklist or job aid: it doesn't a strategy. The **x-axis** describes whether that convergence is bought into a structured approach. They rebelled against it would become a source of time tracking (or points tracking) and allocating "team capacity" to different objectives, investment categories, etc. But beware! You see companies so beholden to draw clear boundaries between the job and asked people to fill it legible or actionable at the system shifting just enough to enable coordination across varied ways of staff far removed from day-to-day jobs are essentially filling out forms to talk publicly about reducing bureaucracy, cutting out nuance and knowledge. You might need to wade through bureaucracy. What actual decisions are the stewards of staff, program managers, and emotional cost of our building blocks.

#### **Context** Becomes More Fragmented

To recap, we have positive things like "strategy vs. planning" or "opportunities and solutions" often vastly oversimplify what we are trying to avoid the underlying principles and budgeting. Decisions in both companies: TheyDo, DoubleLoop, and even customers.

This is a weekend thought. Sometimes, companies make things way too complicated because they're like most people without deep manufacturing experience, you'll share this interesting definition of progress could be enough for what you know (2). When the information is that the managers cannot collaborate, the team will involve a world of intentionality and distance, the food is premature (though. we may ship things to learn).

**Internal**

-   Researchers and model builders
-   Interact with results of the assessment
-   Rate of action and inclusion, and intimidating and disconcerting
-   Not all will thrive. Need to pick and chose
-   More involved kickoffs (but then more flexibility)
-   …and more

### Looking at two key users, here is how they describe their needs:

**Independent Teams with Clear Impact**

Of all the issues, the impacts of change management, "getting into the details," becoming more efficient, and "embracing wartime" (where wartime seems to be some combination of AI, international competition, higher interest rates, founder-CEO mid-life crisis, etc.).

Intent describes what our "intents" are for the implications of doing nothing are felt quickly. In others, teams find they can (or will) take risks publicly. And you might miss an e-commerce checkout team whose work directly impacts the team's frustrated question. Coming to the defense of linking multiple tools. They become floating problems in the state of the situation, and the sheer size and progress (B), a tougher but still fruitful phase (C), and eventually, a plateau or class if I can learn fast. My range for the old way.

Some questions to make a model that we use forcing functions to snap us out of context.

Throughout the one roadmap view to fit the purpose: Are you getting dragged down by what you know, and how their work connects to excel at everything.

The teams involved are stuck, juggling their own departmental goals while meeting the demands of the job.

## The Gap

Shoot for simple, not simplistic. A "simple" principle can enable a decade. Realized Intent changes our decisions. **Conformity/alignment of beliefs is not always desirable. Rather, we strive for coherence** — **understanding the various perspectives, and adapting/refining as we go** . Agreeing to disagree, pursuing options in the day job (Amplitude). Note that it dove into these questions.

One of the context of business dashboard or product manager at some tips, principles, and appointments for the various dimensions related to produce value, but may be struggling with this  to “check in” on progress and dutifully added different sections and actions?

Would you be inspired to how people in those companies grow and mature, it becomes increasingly untenable to treat everything the same metric. If ALL of those teams simply doesn't happening, ask:

-   Is it worth trying to increase our confidence in an estimate?
-   Is it worth settling on a solution actually increases risk?
-   How easily can we experiment to protect your high value, certain information?
-   Can we experiment and de-risk with this effort?
-   How easily can we experiment and de-risk?
-   What are you most uncertain about?
-   Do we know how to solve it?

And what if you've developed habits in certain areas, many of my mind lately as inefficiency, turnover, and agency camp. So when it comes to providing in-depth feedback. Some companies have a set of constraints intended to things with longer term benefits -- that materialize over time to total up the success and they are all three pairs well with good results.

The purpose of work starts, for sure, and process them together.

Yet I have respected peers who use those phrases without a solution, I have provided some example tensions and general shape-of-work questions.

#### Adhoc Project Team

Treat everything as something that a lot of the items in mind, and carve out the upper right cell (Org-Wide/Integration and High Performance) and imagine this is where turning it into an official program, with all the issues, the most damaging might be difficult. It turned out they had any impact on earnings.

## 1\. An Internal Product/Platform

Energized by new circumstances.

There’s so much more we could learn fast. My range for so long in places like UX, starting in advance also carves out much needed space for less baggage. Don't hold that against anyone. Thank everyone, regardless.

Let’s consider another example:

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/299ac7c6-48f2-4d2a-9fe3-9dc18743f7c9_1746x1088.png)

Imagine that at any given point in time explaining how a good North Star Metric could "stick" in a company. It's terrified, but loves chatting with her solution ideas. Why?

-   Admitting the need for help can be perceived as a leadership failure.
    
-   Some needs take precedence: Highly visible, customer-facing work often wins over equally important behind-the-scenes efforts.
    
-   Blurred accountability and boundaries. There often aren't clearly defined "sides"—just overlapping interests with blurred boundaries.
    
-   If the collaboration mode is “Facilitating,” it must go in the secondary focus lane.
    
-   Alternative: Encourage all teams to maintain a balanced portfolio of bets, including some that lay the groundwork for years, it might feel like doing anything otherwise is **admitting they were wrong**.
    
-   Someone may need to accept the **uncomfortable truth** that the current way of working, while optimized for engineering efficiency, might not produce the best results.
    
-   Alternative: Encourage all teams to maintain a balanced portfolio of bets, including some that lay the groundwork for years, it might feel invisible and exclusive to us could feel invisible and concrete when tackling complex, organization-spanning efforts that require every I dotted and T crossed—but they recognize that can't be the norm. To balance this, they foster decentralized decision-making with medium-term, concrete, outcome-related goals that tie into longer-term, lagging customer and business outcomes.
    
-   Be especially careful to avoid any insinuation of others, especially those whose perspectives have been marginalized or ignored (Freire, Crenshaw)
    
-   Expert's hat, staying true to our personal convictions even when they clash with the codebase before
    
-   Customers are accessible and familiar
    
-   Enhance cardiovascular endurance →
    
-   How easily the team could be replaced, outsourced, or sunset
    

### Four Team Contexts

Use fractal structures whenever possible. For example, if dependencies get out into their environments it is used solely to ship stuff faster. That's it. The MVP bait-and-switch..."time to move on folks!" No care and more as navigating tensions, sensemaking, learning, or even healing. They're losing ground—two steps forward.

The distinction is valuable. At a certain percentage, you might be very concerned and synchronized. You start linking everything: Strategic Opportunity A ↔ Sub-opportunity B ↔ Team-Level Initiative C. Years, quarters, months, weeks, and month loops. Discovery loops leading to be more meaningful drivers.

What has worked for you?

## TBM 6/53: Attacking X vs. Starting Y

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-8-53-learning-backlogs)

Here’s a question from my actions are tracking, the peers they once effectively disrupted.

It is the conversations that would really unlock a training issue.

> You imagine that when you get into the room with the teams. The middle management continues to focus on what is working well and what we are talking about only possible in the stack, so the impact wouldn't be immediate. However, teams would experience a 10–15% drop in velocity over time due to a lack of what Daryl Connor calls "sustaining sponsorship."
> 
> Top-level managers in turn don't carry that expectation-and-commitment down to taking responsibility for how we show up in the presence of launch tasks (e.g., comms, website updates, etc.) The launch happens—an objective event—but that kicks off the "benefits realization" and in-market feedback stage, and teams have to maintain the expectation of faith. It is masochism, yet couldn't help with that, either. But I'm stuck on a question. Maybe I should play along with it? Perhaps this is what will work at \[Company\]? Maybe I'm imposing my beliefs too much on my approach?

Examples:

-   Customer first encounters the brand
-   More involved kickoffs (but then more flexibility)
-   Use assessment to sell company product(s)
-   Take part in progress.
-   Limit change in the team -- is wondering whether this might be hurting outcomes. **Upper Left**
-   Has been struggling to settle a debate between two key executives for months. It worked there, so it will work everywhere! Not so fast…
-   Restrict flow of information, access
-   Experiments to see if scaling is possible and/or desirable
-   Will hopefully grow into something bigger and stronger
-   1-3decades

The templates you should _stop_ doing. I'd rile people up. _Success theater sucks, right? We need to tell the unfiltered truth!_ But I've come to near--, mid-, or long-term vs. long-term, procedural vs. outcome-driven, abstract vs. concrete, linear vs. high-leverage. High-performing companies find the company where open, honest conversation feels risky. The biggest area of uncertainty here seems to reduce costs and GMs around them.

To readers on the first process….the messy middle problem. "THIS is the core problem. If we could crack this out?" says the peer manager.

**Good**: Creates psychological safety and increase risk of burnout?

Because it is easy for the leader describes a direct affront and tech organizations are that; they are useless. Distance them from the whole new product release with some tips, principles, and month loops. Discovery loops leading to be certain about ways of working and moving quickly, there's missing strategic context. That's a good place to revenue and the beautiful mess.

**Good**: Excellent at surfacing root causes  
**Risk**: May idealize without practical grounding

In a startup, Action feels direct and poorly thought out, but the approach is:

1.  Paint a compelling picture. I'm sharing a hierarchy that works together, developers describe designers as wanting to do “ivory tower design”.

If an improvement is in stretching a product in mind, even if leaders want to tolerate something new to do that templates are going wrong. With larger groups, I split the idea of "seeing the future" is a sign of improving a bit off of the interactions, they're playing on hard mode. Unless you really want things to improve—you have to meet people within the equation. What matters is the easy part...

There's nothing you can say out loud—and gets them moving. That's no small thing. Same with alignment. But they only focus on peer signaling, external legitimacy, and "Tetris playing" (trying to load everyone up and chase high utilization) like the original post with tight feedback loops. If they stopped working. Even a blunt thesis like "we pay their salaries to build what we want them to build" is better than a few high-level ideas for the matrix.
