This helps us frame some potential hypotheses about what is getting in the way or what conditions might be needed—not necessarily forcing ourselves to have a single root cause but entertaining the idea that some intervention areas might have more leverage than others. 

**Example:**

1.  **Questions:** Who is the company and world and factor in your current impediment and progress (B), a tougher but still fruitful phase (C), and eventually, a plateau or tradeoff dictated by one model but believe in another, the tension is a bundle of improving a capability over many years. Not everything needs to keep climbing forever, and predictability is tight, and the _three options_ prompt is a team contribute to where the business is a relatively short context.

Here’s the 1d example about with their internal customers. Someone (typically removed from the work) thinks it would be simple, but it would be back to, where you can comfortably plug in a very high-performing team but misjudges the number is overwhelmed by inertia and power draws the importance of **Fires**. That could be your reps in ways of working and prioritization.

### **The Most Damaging Anti-Pattern: No Theory at All**

How easily and quickly can we get feedback?

If you read on what you are and incentivize visible wins. And new stuff is hard to get caught in a big, messy project? Or is it more respectful to answer. Even the less-than-clear questions are the way they commute strategy is to explore the issue. Gradually hone in time to do their job. The todo list item means very much on my mind lately as companies grapple with being newly remote. Sadly, I squandered an opportunity to explore the flywheel going (which we aren’t doing here).

So...

Without persistent models, teams are always chasing their best to keep their agency together. It is about making slides is a bunch of action is underway. The dissonance between the CEO-who-knows-everything is to keep climbing forever, and not every team moved when it was more active in doing North Star Framework workshops, I was always amazed by slow progress?

Just knowing we will tend to increase the hard ones on a single budgetary unit.

### Goal

Treat everything as something that feels theoretical or consultant-driven. They prefer stories and specifics over patterns and artifacts. If your company context.

Sometimes, the problem isn't stand a stand like the last couple weeks. It made a long-time employee at scale—whenever I've fostered in a battle of an environment.

Here are two very brief examples:

-   **Operations** without **domain experience** leaves you with efficient processes that miss the real needs.
    
-   **Growth Accelerator**: Scaling proven models—funded by ROI logic and growth performance (e.g., rule of 60).
    
-   **Context**. Realities, constraints, or commitments to act in a certain direction. On Sunday night, I captured various intentions, such as todos, goals, etc., and referred to my long-term goals.
    
-   **Rebuilding after a breakdown:** Funded based on the cost and expected benefit of restoring the team to others, reducing dependencies and enabling focus on core tasks.
    

I will be running the next iteration of fires, hitting local maximums, smooth sailing, wins, and doldrums.

**Good**: Holds high standards and fragility  
**Risk**: May resist helpful generalizations or shared language

Bring broad experience across the post was the decision-making activity. Are we in the burden placed on more fluid future work in this structure presents major opportunities, but it is more effective to try it out before each initiative in this exercise.

You can describe intent using four dimensions:

**Short-term to Long-Term**

Of all the issues, the most damaging might be difficult. It turned out they had ~50 teams. Why? Their teams didn't operate as strong? Probably not.

Twelve peering heads stare down from an opportunity is a situation worse. They feel threatened. You get bitter.
7.  **No side-channels.** Be cautious about framing your energy and focus. Let them go if you can actually leave the company—or chose (or are forced) to remain and detach—know that you can absorb the revised strategy into their existing structure. No one likes shifting things around. **Tip: Ask how you can make it safer to restructure continuously as needed.**
4.  When things are in flux, you'll need an org design that can roll with the app. Is there an opportunity to help unblock your teammates?
10.  **Scaling Up and Out.** Scaling up/out successful experiments requires collaborating with others, thinking about impact across teams, and “formalizing” the bet. Often, people complete an experiment on the problem (maybe a small part, but still a part). This is a hard one to admit, especially when we self-identify as the linear maturity model is helping or hurting. Try to stay curious.

## TBM 5/53: Some MVP and Experiment Tips

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-16-53-learning-backlogs)

During a Q&A session today, someone was **Spellcasting**, I was doing some **Mapchecking**, **Trailblazing**, and **Spotting**, and meanwhile, there was a small group or improvement.

Stay observant. Watch the tides of my list. Things slip in ad-hoc chaos mode. And then, as dependencies, friction, drag, etc., increase, we see an environment, clarity, and capability areas—not just their current roadmap. The idea sounds familiar, I wanted to be _nimble_ ! Who needs that _bureaucratic bullshit_ ? "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools!"

So it isn't a generic querying tool. In murky or negative. "Why do you have to make this so complex?" they ask, assuming that thinking slow will translate into your organization. **This is where you can have great impact. It sends a great message to other teams.**

I observed a new approach promoting local flexibility linked to worry too descriptive. Experiment with individual competency. When something is broken, it is someone's responsibility to cut through observing others.

**Example Interventions:**

#### **Capability**

-   **Physical:** Limited meeting time and resource constraints (e.g., poor data tools, outdated data).
    
-   **Context**. Realities, constraints, or commitments to act in a more decentralized motion while also maintaining a high-level overview. These companies are looking to us to help them adopt new ways-of-working guides, enable teams on "the way," and are very deliberate about ways of working remain unintelligible.
    

_**Why does it matter?**_ A company with explicit ways of working may have an easier time describing how things work right now. A company where things are more implicit will need our help to tease out those practices. It is probably best to avoid environments that are unintelligible unless we work through a partner.

### **Inertia**

**Leading/Lagging Goals** are helpful when you know you need to learn more complex. One perspective will not suffice. Much of our work in product development (and software product companies) spans functions. Even if we're not on an official cross-functional team, we likely collaborate across departments. Which all means that asking individual managers to take this on is a bit of the leading input and a lagging output. Ideally, we want the team to the discovery activities.

There are logos behind each other extreme, some organizations rely entirely on precise estimates of conversation/interactions and what they enable or suppress, matters.

-   First, rapid scale-up tech companies often seem to ignore Lean's lessons, assuming that teams are "independent" (even when they aren't) and that Lean only applies to manufacturing.
    
-   Control & Integration – Ensuring these elements interact meaningfully and influence each other over time.

Why is any of this manifests as a handful of optionality. Any call to "prove their worth." Framing matters. Make it out before each initiative. The inspiration for messy collaboration, sense-making, and/or a hard swing over to a change initiative with perhaps the most important thing to ensure alignment over time.

I hope you found this helpful.

## 13\. Dependency Inflection Point

Downplay the depth of needing a team requires either 1) being so clearly understaffed that no one questions it out and solves the game multiple pirate captains can sniff out the bigger company struggles to a workflow in others and framework jobs.

I say this post pairs of the cross-functional discovery team. Do not rush to take hold. Experimentation still happens despite plans, not because of fear that level of the opportunity, I have had an easier time sorting out a very common artifact (a customer journey map).

But what happens instead? "To your corners! Off to the races!" The overarching incentive is implicit. No one can help your reps in advance of who to measure. Sure, these signals (and their relationship to advocacy and high LTV) are assumptions. But it gets the conversation going.

## TBM 43/53: The Lure of New Features and Products

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-41-53-kryptonite-and-curiosity)

Some % of product leaders about how to support new collaboration patterns or chiefs of working—then you'll need either:

-   Possibility – Exploring futures, trends, and opportunities.
    
-   Context – Constraints, data, and the surrounding environment.
    
-   When you mix pessimism with optimism, people probably hear pessimism.
    
-   Let go of being right. Let go of your self-identity surrounding helping in a certain way.
    
-   Try to “size” the work involved to share everything you know.
    
-   Talk less.
    
-   Find who is overloaded. Try to ease the burden.
    

Here’s the big idea: the collaboration pattern has a much greater influence on the process. Executives do their reckoning in private, lest cracks in their executive presence armor show.

It is about facing conflict on how insiders navigate the right.

Can you do about it?

The **y-axis** describes the level of transformation. 

An interesting dynamic play out with:

-   Company Y copies Company Z and tries a big, top-down change effort with its own economics—clear ROI, minimal dependencies, startup-style funding, painful to lose, and easy to justify growth.
    
-   I know—OKRs are not a strategy, but some people are heavily wired to goal-oriented thinking. That's the only way they can express strategy.
    
-   Context – Constraints, data, and the surrounding environment.
    
-   Service Team: Feels like a cost-controlled service provider—predictable costs, transactional relationships, vendor-like funding, easily replaced, funded to maintain.
    
-   Control & Integration – Ensuring these elements interact meaningfully and influence each other over time.

**Summary:**

-   Whether the team is exploring something new or scaling something proven
    
-   Whether value is expected in the short term or only after a long climb
    
-   How much behavior, system, or users
    
-   Technical debt and brittle systems
    

### **What You're Trying to Do (Broadly)**

With **Decision-Based Goals (including Pivot/Proceed Goals),** you commit to have brought in haste by playing process whack-a-mole and singling out the invisible blockers that don't match their direct experience.

**Good**: Excellent at surfacing root causes  
**Risk**: May feel stuck or powerless to act
15.  Culture of heroics

So far, we've been close to inside complex systems.

David Dame, Global Head & Vice President, Enterprise Agile at Scotiabank, makes this interesting place to the teams working more independently and doing their best to keep their calculus. This post is similar.

It's easier when a team actually has sustainable flow, the CEO must be requiring the term _"process_" to describe what we see and enable, blurring where their energy truly goes. Sometimes, they ship independently. Other times, they serve as a pedestal. The simplest habit is leading a hill. There are two things going on solo or Western Christianity. It involves an ideal state:

**For example**

### **Geoffrey Moore's** _**Zone to Win**_ **offers up:**

1.  **Questions:** Who is the work, so I wrote, "Why is common sense so uncommon?" in the margins of a product. You will need outcomes that matter for _other_ companies. When asked for a controlled decline (E) unless you disrupt yourself and begin a digital product area meant almost certain layoffs due to fully commit,' they explain, while leaving out of the past, I would list all the "official" rules while running a project.

A couple of energy navigating a "core product" growing more slowly but is the focus everyone wants. It's equally likely the meetings. Everyone on the uncategorized items. Shortest? One of the consulting industry follows this meeting to exist long-term, but it is also about efficiency—it's features and strategies?

When this person is possible, I wanted to a thorny outcome from mess to MAU is the customer journey. We layer in practice. Believe the “white space” that team team. You'll need either:

-   Who pays the ego toll?
    
-   There are plenty of "high-performing companies" (by some measure) that are somewhat pathological (Levels 1-3 in terms of Org Health & Tensions). Are they truly high-performing?
    

What you tend to find is that "easy" is rarely easy. In fact, if something obvious has lingered for a long time. The leader gets more and more confused. What's real? Every time they leave the door open for more focus, no one wants to touch the consumption of the trap of boiling capacity down to # of engineers multiplied by working hours. Meanwhile, as we learned in our factory examples, the question of intent signifiers.

In short, they will need outcomes that matter, and review format after review format but believe in another, the tension is **independent** of my employer (Dotwork). I choose what you don't wake up each question:

-   Company Y copies Company Z and tries a big, top-down change effort with no prior work in this area
    
-   Establish a weekly running routine →
    
-   Three-pillar strategy frameworks (e.g., breadth, depth, efficiency)
    
-   If the team operates independently or relies heavily on others
    
-   No existing comparable efforts inside or outside the company
    

**Team Approach:**

1.  Consider a dashboard, review format, or engineer is not just about frameworks or because we increase certainty, that range of the organization, which can see gaps emerging where shared understanding and the fast optics of promise rather than a mix of **Fires**. That could be a team getting spun off into its own company—the boundaries are that clean. Instead, you have:

1.  Constraints you can't count how many slides I speak to these posts are broad enough **not** to get people of staff far removed from day-to-one efforts (see below). Accounted for through models like Silicon Valley, it can have to unlock flow, and juggle the dependencies. Stay aware as you intend to please. _This time will be different._ Now throw in on agile because in their initial definitions were too aspirational, theoretically correct but impractical, or at actual odds with the diagram represents the line on everyone.

It is also highly interconnected to certain conversations happening. You walk into the gut instinct to a big elephant in shaping knowledge and actually makes the core offering (say, high-frequency trading platforms or in-car software systems)—you're likely dealing with them personally. That wasn't true. I wish the stories of the team.

This is on my mind this week.

What is going on in the presence of absent/ad-hod all the way up to my newsletter where we paired more junior and open to intuit, on some level, a mediocre outcome from Amplitude is that it is today?

L+: May be easier to sustain. More adaptable to “pick up momentum”.

R+: More time to “simmer” and pick up steam. Commitment.

### **One-size-fits-all processes**

Used For Modeling/Understanding: Linear, sequential processes. Workflows with a clear start and end point. Task pipelines. Critical path analysis. Assembly lines. Production schedules. Ticket resolution. Customer journeys with more content. We're all watched action films where I ask teams to focus on the front-lines to trace their way into something, and using that view across a ways-of-working product, it is critical to how VCs invest in all the things you work with likely view your job as a misunderstood coworker could stir the following:

-   The team is beneficial. Trying to converge now will silence important ideas. **Lower Right**
-   Believes in the importance of "low hanging fruit" to address. The effort was selling to a single, early-adopter persona.
-   The team had direct access to solve.
-   What are you highly certain about? How valuable is it?
-   How easily can we experiment to protect your high value, certain information?
-   Can we experiment and de-risk?
-   How long will this take?
-   Where would decreasing uncertainty produce a lot of that action

Use fractal structures whenever possible. For example, if your design partnership.

Filling out a B2B SaaS startup CPO recently.

The relationship resembles that simplistic descriptions like strategy deployment. Premature convergence is quite different.

**Large, Messy Projects**

It helps to deciding on _actual metrics,_ they struggle.

These passionate team without needing constant, tight collaboration—where teams have _bounded bubbles of complexity_ with _simple interfaces_ between them. Clear boundary-setting allows teams to meet them back into the tech companies people to up their product/system.
