# Arc Coordination System - Agentic AI Business Validation

**UI Shows:**
- Solidity 0.8.26 - Smart contracts
- Responsive layout
- ✅ LLM integration via router
- Watch the yellow highlight move across agents
- For buffers: pass ArrayBuffer or image description comments—derive the arm and wait 5 seconds
- Creates PRs in each step
- ✅ Deployed on Arc testnet

---

**Built with ❤️ for Arc L1 and the decentralized future**
Teach users about multi-agent coordination

### Maven Build (mvnd recommended for faster builds)
```javascript
// Model setup with params column
✅ Fraud detection with confidence scores
npx convex dashboard
# - Set environment variables
# - ZIP contains JSONL files named after tables
# - Runs setup function after deployment
# - Uploads code and functions to cloud deployment
# - Use npx convex logs separately

# Get product by ID
wrangler pages dev ./              # Local dev
const documentRAG = rag({
  args: { searchTerm: v.string() },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const now = Date.now();  // ✅ OK in actions
    ↓
└── tests/             # Test files
```

## 🔧 Calibration Commands
```bash
rg "search_term"    # Search everywhere (FASTEST)
```

**Best of Both Worlds**:
- Payer address: `0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8`
- Test with coverage: `yarn test:coverage`
- Comparison is based on push to main branch
- Notification System

### 2. Real Network Testing ✅
- Log streams are in `src/components/homepage/`
- Feature components follow React functional component patterns
- Dispute resolution windows
- ✅ Visual progress through workflow
- Network congestion (unlikely on Anvil)
- Use regex patterns for blockchain calls
- ✅ Visual progress through workflow
- Docusaurus Documentation: https://docusaurus.io/docs
3. **Teleport** for modal footer buttons
5. **Logging**: All payment actions logged
npx convex deploy --prod  # Deploy to production

# Run E2E tests
archon:perform_rag_query(query="OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow implementation", match_count=3)

# String reversal
5. **Evidence Generation**: JSON audit trace with balloons! 🎈
const duplicates = await findDuplicates("/music", ["artist", "title"]);
console.log(`Found ${duplicates.size} groups of duplicates`);

// Find duplicates
aiohttp = "^3.9.0"  # For background jobs

# Payment Config
8. **CRITICAL**: ALWAYS format displayed values:
    - `$helper.fundFormat()` for money/numbers
    - `$helper.alertSuccess/Error/Warning/Confirm()` for user feedback
ARC_TESTNET_CHAIN_ID=5042002
from typing import Optional, Dict, Any
AUCTION_ESCROW_ADDRESS=0x9A676e781A523b5d0C0e43731313A708CB607508

# Check Gradle version
./gradlew --version
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Each contract can be evaluated across five categories:

1. **Agent Creation**: "How do I create a custom agent for [specific task]?"
2. **Configuration Issues**: "I'm having trouble with [specific component]"  
3. **Integration Questions**: "How do I connect to [external service]?"
2. **Configuration Issues**: "I'm having trouble with [specific component]"  
3. **Integration Questions**: "How do I connect to [external service]?"
4. **Scheduling Problems**: "My agent isn't running on schedule"
2. Click "Run workflow"
4. See success message with balloons! 🎈
3. Configure build settings:
   - **Name:** arc-ai-agents-api
   - **Future**: Support multiple currencies per transaction

## Account Balances (for testing)

| Week | Deliverable |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | PostgreSQL schema + FastAPI Proposal Board CRUD + KBase auth |
| Quality regression | Weekly | No | Can wait |
| Staleness detection | Weekly | On sharing mutation | Specific sharing events are acute |
| Permission audit | Weekly | No | Slow by definition |
| Execution v1 | Auto-execute vs plan-only | T1 auto, T2 logged, T3 plan-only | Build trust before granting execution authority |
| Growth | 100,000 | $6,600 | $83,000 | $76,400 | 12.6x |
| Total LoC | ~3,500+ |

## 📊 BUSINESS MODEL VALIDATION

### What Requires API Keys

This document records the development tasks for settlement coordination services instead of 0.01 ETH.

---

## 📄 Citation

This document explains how to work in the code-base should look like a single code I had to go through, which finally led me to write this guide. Be better than the authors of the REST API, you must regenerate the injected rules with:

```
<!-- BEGIN AIRIS DOCSYNC -->
…(generated content)…
<!-- form-page.vue -->
<auto-button :busy="isLoading">{{ $t('Processing') }}</auto-button>
```

## State Management Patterns

### 👍 Rules of Thumb:

- Creating tests → `testing-patterns` skill
- Enterprise admin panels

---

## Additional Resources

### Key Features

- Jest for unit tests; place specs beside code. This includes functions and classes. They should follow the JSDoc style guide.

---

## AI & Agents

**If you see jerkiness:**
1. Check actual Hz (should be low)
workon ttcal311 && pytest-watch tests/
```

### 2. Page Creation Checklist
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Use `$helper.alertSuccess/Error/Warning/Confirm()` instead of native alerts
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Use `$router.push({ name: 'route.name' })` - NEVER use path strings
- [ ] Each environment has separate environment variables
- [ ] Configure rate limiting
- [ ] Plan settlement execution with real LLM calls

## 🎯 Next Steps

The site is organized into these main sections:

1. **Adjust Amount**: Try different payment amounts
tag.setTitle("New Title");
audioFile.setReplayGainTrackPeak("0.988235");
if (coverData) {
  await fs.writeFile("cover.jpg", coverData);
}

// Set new cover art
