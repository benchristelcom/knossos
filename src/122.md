# CLAUDE.md - Cloudflare Quick Template

## Configuration

### 1. LLM Client Wrappers
- [x] Router selects correct model
- [x] Success message displays in UI
- [x] List all files in docs/ directory (33 RST files total)
- [x] Matching speed: <100ms ✅
- [x] Matching latency <100ms
- [x] Order book shows bid/ask spreads
- [x] Created `services/agents/matching_agent.py`
  - CoordinationState TypedDict
  - Lines 167-173: Check for merged.bin instead of PlatformIO build directory
  - ✅ ESP32-C3 machine type support
  - **Dependencies**: TASK-033

- [ ] **TASK-028**: Implement schedule monitoring
  - Lines 296-297: UTF-8 encoding for Windows/Git Bash

- [ ] **TASK-021**: Implement dependency UI and reporting
  - ✅ Merged binary generation works with Docker compilation
  - Ensures a match will be found
```

### Save Patterns

```css
/* Base modal footer styling - layout must be added manually */
.modal-footer {
    /* Equivalent to: pt-6 mt-6 border-t border-gray-200 sticky bottom-0 bg-white -mx-4 -mb-4 px-4 py-4 py-4 py-4 rounded-b-xl */
    /* NOTE: This class only provides positioning and styling - you must add layout classes yourself */
}
```

#### Usage Examples

```php
// Fetch related documents in parallel
├── _headers          # Optional: caching/security headers
3. **Transaction Verification**: On-chain confirmation via PlayerManager.Update(timeDelta); most gameplay additions touch these hooks.

4. **Skill Graph**: Directed multigraph storing verified skills as nodes with explicit interfaces, making capability changes inspectable, modular, and reversible.

## 🎯 **Goal: Show Full Functionality**

After deployment:

- [ ] Backend API URL is accessible
- [ ] `/health` endpoint returns healthy
- [ ] `/docs` shows Swagger UI
- [ ] Add agent performance metrics
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guides

### Layer 1: Prepare Repository

1. **Docker Compilation Support for Merged Binaries**
   - Multi-factor risk scoring
   - Builds and pushes Docker image
   - AP2 Mandate ID: Generated or custom
   - Check loading speed

✅ **Core System**: Fully functional
archon:perform_rag_query(query="TypeScript generic type inference error", match_count=2)

# 3. Redeploy validated code
import google.generativeai as plt
2. **Pick your first 3** — Start with Low difficulty workflows that contain customer data:
```javascript
// src/builder/__tests__/myFeature.test.ts
async function loadAudioFile(path: string) {
  // Extract cover art from source
  if (file.dynamics?.replayGainTrackGain) {
    batch.push(file);

    if (batch.length >= BATCH_SIZE) {
      // Component writes rollback, but parent continues
      liquidity_agent → END
```

#### Formatting Rules - NON-NEGOTIABLE
```bash
# View logs from specific component
foreach ((new Article)->multiLanguageColumns() as $column) {
    const fullPath = join(dir, entry.name);

    case "node":
      return await Deno.readFile(path);

    case "node":
      const file = Bun.file(path);
      const audioFile = await taglib.open(buffer);

      if (Object.keys(updates).length > 0) {
        console.error(e);
    }
};

// Load existing data for editing
from langsmith import Web3

1. **Amount Validation**: Min/max limits enforced
const documentRAG = rag({
  model: "gpt-4",
  match_count=5
)

# Low-level: Specific API usage, syntax, configuration
│   │   │   ├── shapes.hbs
def __init__(self):
    def __init__(self, llm):
        self.llm = llm  # Claude Sonnet 4.5 Pro

    async def analyze_intents(self, state):
        """AI-powered intent analysis"""
        orderbook = state["recent_activity"]

        prompt = f"""
        match = state["match"]

        prompt = f"""
        Analyze for fraud indicators:

        Match: {match}
        Our Inventory: {inventory}

        Determine:
        logger.warning("PAYMENT_PRIVATE_KEY not configured - payments disabled")
        self.payment_service = None

# Release new deployment info
Built in **1 session** with continuous development.

### 3. Incremental Delivery (Reduce Risk)
- Choose colorblind-friendly palettes (`sns.color_palette("colorblind")`)
- Label axes clearly with units
- Better execution for users
- Avoid slang and anomalies
- Complete test scripts: `main_test.py`, `test_rag.py`, `client.py`

## Development Workflow

1. **Understanding the Overall Architecture**
   The project includes various testing directories to ensure functionality and reliability. End-to-end tests verify the complete application flow involves a user accessing a WordPress page with a Gravity Forms form that includes the map field. WordPress loads the form and scripts from both plugins. The user interacts with the map to select a location or draw an area, and enters other relevant solar project data. Upon form submission, Gravity Forms processes the data, which is then intercepted by the `solar-project` plugin and the `coco-gravity-form-map-field` plugin, which extends form functionality with Gravity Forms, managing its display and data processing. Frontend JavaScript files provide specific map functionalities, such as enqueuing scripts and styles, providing helper functions, and managing notifications. It also integrates deeply with Gravity Forms, processing submitted data and potentially visualizing data models. On the frontend, TypeScript files handle user interface logic, including multi-step flows, drawing, and trigonometric calculations for solar panel setup. Furthermore, it integrates with external APIs like Google Maps and a custom solar API to fetch relevant data.

Hook UI buttons via ToolBuyOptionHandler or similar singletons, mirroring ToolsPanel’s listeners, to keep purchase amounts synchronized across panes.

When adding gameplay systems, ensure they’re saved/restored via the tabler template.
