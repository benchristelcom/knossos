# Arc Coordination System - Agentic AI Architecture Plan

**Backend**:
- After matching: Matches found? → market+fraud, else → liquidity
- Deployment settings

### Phase 4 (Production)
- [ ] Full autonomous operation mode working
- [ ] Developer documentation for ERC-20 transfers (~65,000 gas)

**2. Set Environment Variables:**

- Code written for Convex 1.0+ will continue to work without modification
- Document assumptions and limitations

### Repopulate Data Structure
```bash
./render.sh
```

### Type Checking (after adding type hints)
```python
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Created: Agent spawned
    columns: list[ColumnInfo]
    Rig2 --> Polecats2[Polecats<br/>Worker agents]

    style Mayor fill:#e1f5ff
    │  RISK AGENT    │  │ FRAUD AGENT  │  │ • Verify proofs │   │
    result = obj.some_method()

    # Run for 1000 iterations
    top_k: 10
```

### Step 2: Add .gitignore

You can customize:
- ✅ Continuous integration testing
- Most agents don't actually need LLMs

**Tasks**:
1. Removed buggy `settle_payment_onchain()` method
2. Start auction engine in the correct answer - give grounded and hallucination-free answers.

<script setup>
const $settingStore = inject('$settingStore');
</script>
```

### Form Component Features
- **Presentation**: 8-minute slide deck + 2-4 minutes Q&A
- **Backend vars**: Set via CLI for routing
- **Production-ready** with comprehensive testing and memory management
- **JSON Payloads**: Formatted and expandable
- **Parallelize database operations** using `Promise.all()` instead of sequential `await` calls
- **After**: Link only shown after 120+ second confirmation wait
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance checks
