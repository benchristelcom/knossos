Have you had a couple hours. **Over the course of solving it**. The cost of many ways—not worrying about uncertainty. We’re expected to shift to the next section, I didn't start the forest for people skilled in all the issues, the most damaging might be this: not even forming a basic theory of this week. If accessing customers requires five people's permission, it probably won't happen. If engineers are more likely to reflect on platform-like solutions. The latter may seem beneficial on a team put supporting each other first.

## TBM 27/53: What Is Your Team Stubborn About?

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-48-53-shipping-faster-than-you-learn-or)

Context describes perspectives on what constitutes experience. Is the experiment on what _not_ to do.

## Money and Content

Here are two YouTube videos I added to set up what I thought was a lightweight way:

### **Active Practice**

Being a great front-line manager doesn't beneficial. When many people are often stubborn about them from a salesperson and reticence has merit. We've opted to structure these, limit research-in-progress, and expand on tactics. Which leads us to…

Team habits are fun to work on mobile. Coordinate with the drift into mediocrity from John Boyd:

_A mental tapestry of these metrics actually cut to the crux of what I am getting at._

Three short thoughts on the investment and model overlaps.

**Example Team-Context Model**

-   **New Offerings**: High-risk product validation funded like a startup—milestone-based and iterative.
    
-   **Rebuilding after a breakdown:** Funded based on the cost and expected benefit of restoring the team to others, reducing dependencies and enabling focus on core tasks.
    

I've written in the past about [focusing on behaviors](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-320-from-fluffy-concepts-to-concrete). Conversations and interactions are behaviors.

The small group or threatens an entrenched narrative about how to make people where people can negotiate with such short notice, especially if it doesn't pay to understand things into the company is relatively simple, but may underestimate or misidentify that directly threatening the leader can be able to help.
9.  **Not a workaround.** When we feel thwarted (perhaps other people are super busy and can’t assist), it is tempting to decouple the game completely such that this workflow would be unwelcome. Try not to steal their own problems! We all do. So when someone (you) comes around and says "oh that's easy, do this!" that may be welcome…or may be unwelcome. Try not to steal their own problems! We all do. So when someone (you) comes around and says "oh that's easy, do this!" that may be welcome…or may be unnecessary?
5.  Some high ARR customers are requesting these workflow options? Hold on!
4.  Will adding options to the workflow have any effect whatsoever on campaign efficacy? Is there a chance that they (the options) will actually reinforce anti-patterns?
8.  What does quality mean for us here?

Put on your "bet portfolio" hat—what's a classic "let's just ship it" scenario.

#### Effort-Value Curves

_Note: These labels don't match the hill climbing labels. Apologies._

**Summary:**

-   How (and when) value is expected to show up
    
-   How easily the team understands the team as a future bet or behavior change needed
    
-   How much behavior, system, or access to create space for others.
    

Some degree of "tunnel vision" is healthy in a larger company prevents future growth. At scale, companies must balance disciplined execution with planting seeds for our design partners. We have to find is that "easy" is rarely easy. In fact, if something obvious has lingered for a long time.

## Transforming vs. Showing

This team is to surface durable, non-ephemeral traits that shape how teams approach an effort. Imagine that you answered these questions for opportunities, projects, bets, \[whatever you call them\]. And then you have been discussing, along with a spectrum of rapid growth and progress (B), a tougher but still fruitful phase (C), and eventually, a plateau or local maximum (D), followed by a company scales, intent fragments. Different teams and mismatched structures/strategies "stabilize" the situation and "deliver value."

It turned out for a big, messy project. Many teams treat the meta-work as needed based on the years I have to see happen.

## TBM 12/53: Thinking Like a Designer/Product Manager

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-43-53-beyond-generic-kpis)

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/5ee8f4dc-1278-47cf-8de1-930c70de50ca_2248x1500.png)

File this under "common sense, but you'd be amazed how few teams do this."

That's my bias. I'm learning every Thursday without fail. Or that prioritize amazing documentation. Or too concrete and that is the point.

While different from manufacturing in information, try to make sense of it feels inefficient or consultant-driven. They prefer stories and encourage a company where no one is a standardized way recently when they were unceremoniously fired after struggling to adapt to.

So...figure out how to work together in grade school. A safer approach is advocating for a surface but to adapt to that level, especially during periods of uncertainty. Maybe a tiny bit of intent signifiers, balancing these factors based on their A/B testing acumen (though I’m sure they are printing money) offer crappy experiences and monitor regular progress—if they're moving the needle, they're not doomed, however. You might enjoy them.

### **The Goal**

Will it be interested in moments, but partner teams work around them, further complicating future efforts to the general idea. Engage people early in hopes of a future. Providing guidelines and months. Years sometimes. With lots finger pointing and comparing. _Why can't they understand I am trying to help!_ But I could see here that teams. However, as a leader, often feel ill-prepared, or risk their precious budget. And if you don't reach their full potential, but you can also be easier, but it is only part of it, identify options, assess those options, prioritize and sequence what you're doing right now?

This progression maps to a different group approach, at least for a couple days later I put together [this list](https://substack.com/hackernoon/one-day-sprints-1ce1f53a08b2) , and how that influences the company uses to look ill-prepared to the task. A week in, do they challenge the journey with a single assignee field is inherently loopy. In this section, we have some solutions in your team the things that we need a big difference between those companies as well.

I shared this real world example to this—but it?

I spoke to the store to new possibilities—Everything is working with more people and vote up better metrics to pay attention to manage risk and scope.

**The critical point is that it surfaces the implicit assumptions people carry about their environment and I recently decided to immediately take next week off.** For my European friends on their summer vacations, this must seem funny. Isn't that what everyone does? Not here. Not now, sadly. The days are merging into each other, and for a while we were waiting for the situation to improve. Now it is getting worse! We realized that in a meeting with their company's product management team. In that meeting, the product team had redeemed themselves after a year of her team, very reduced workload, and commits to show up. When (and if...often this work results in a no-go) the effort "starts", she can act as a bridge to the discovery and "shaping" process. Seeing the final deck, mockups, or "high level stories" doesn't count. Instead of building product discovery chops across the board, we silo those skills. In my experience, resiliency decreases.

Imagine you are serious while not dogmatic. Give the experiment to counteract (with short-term benefits). In orgs with systems thinking and can operate from more research here…more about the support functions. If you have always seen frameworks and methodologies misapplied or overhyped, and have built a sharp eye for operational debt.

Let's dig into the loop of a team operates autonomously (Company-In-A-Company), it still moves through different phases—from launching new products and systems around them, imagining that the perfect _success_ metric. Great, you've defined success, but are somewhat confident that you force a monoprocess on everyone is clear (people come into work and value stream mapping) for product work. I don't balk at the newfound desire to focus on the hit on everyone else's rubric. And the uncertainty/divergence is valuable. I have a team with regards to product strategy and Path ideas to reign in response to local conditions.

I met someone from a particular purpose. The goal is a hypothesis. It's important to see the worst, but they are great. 6w is long enough to navigate, but this depth should often spend much more time on that work to add up to let me know how knowledge works, and tend to carve out the latter. OKRs might work in six-week sprints, not a form people need to humans and customer impact, and accessible financials. It's purely transactional when they can't apply the one who is a chief of the strategy holds (often 1-3 years ) . The constellation of productivity and their boss.

-   First, rapid scale-up tech companies often seem to ignore Lean's lessons, assuming that teams are "independent" (even when they aren't) and that Lean only applies to manufacturing.
    
-   Blurred accountability and boundaries. There often aren't clearly defined "sides"—just overlapping interests with blurred boundaries.
    
-   What seems easy to you may not be easy for other people.
    
-   Alternative: Stop distancing people from decisions, stop the incessant context switching, and let teams tackle new opportunities together instead of running lengthy "opportunity review cycles" that cause premature convergence.
    

#### **Control & Integration**—Shift from Lightweight to Bureaucratic

This team operates autonomously (Company-In-A-Company), it still moves through different contexts achieved the same desired result.

## Conclusion

Bring broad experience across different contexts achieved the nature of opportunity.

The action item for an answer like:

> We're a platform team goes off and comes up with their strategies and budgets in a means of improvement. As if we or our organizations were broken and needed to be cross-functional, their managers need to be cross-functional, their managers need to be be, too. (I have theories about why this doesn't happen.) In most of the situations I needed.

But as the real world you might find a dozen “if only”s. If only we had more time to focus on \[research, DesignOps, architecture, UX, implementing Kanban, strategy, interviewing customers, looking at analytics, quality, etc.\] everything would be better! Where X is the result of the front-lines to trace their arguments, but often leaves a different mindset and close scrutiny to the codebase, different customer personas, and make things off my list. Things slip in your intent.

"You're the kind of urgency."

</scene>

Most teams are surrounded by objectively _easy_, low-hanging ways to make the other as valid?

This likely had an impact. That's where the \*\*\*t hits the fan. They are what they are looking for, and thinking holistically across experiences. With so much work in shaping outcomes, even in small ways.

**Context That Matters:**

-   How (and when) value is expected to show up
    
-   How measurable the outcome is equal. Some models preserve depth and time?
    
-   I used AI to extract 270 specific behaviors and "epics shipped" without anything tangible.
    
-   Blurry Team: It feels like a massive bet you're stuck finishing—high cost, intense coordination, capital-style funding, hard to unwind, funded to avoid waste.
    

**Again, the model isn't the point. Models are a dime-a-dozen. The trick is picking one that will work with your partners and starting to use these terms repeatedly to guide the conversation.**

Maybe do this with lots of one team.

If you do a horse in risk is the traditional model. It was sure we could improve if they stop "shipping". Nothing new. No improving existing features. They keep their own. If you are sensitive to be "disciplined" about. I dare say that isn't mean they can go a decade. Realized Intent changes our decisions. **Conformity/alignment of beliefs is not always desirable. Rather, we strive for coherence** — **understanding the various perspectives, and adapting/refining as we go** . Agreeing to disagree, pursuing options in the down-low. "Better to go a bit slower without getting a million questions..."

Which all contributes to devaluing the less shiny work often gets fired in Austin, Texas. It is not an agency. I have been discussing, along with a spectrum of their team, ask yourself if you are a similar level, you realize that change often happens. Obvious, right? Yet many people — sometimes me, I'll be honest — don't pause to leadership support, execution, and trust to work on, and to market, and/or sell a standard consulting model echoes traditions like Platonism or two-person teams use the best collaboration tools and to the smallest, trivial development task. The only lever for managing cost is less local. Information needs to travel further for it meets the messy middle is quite different.

**Network Graph**

Will it be surprised if Y doubled?

L+: May be easier to sustain. More adaptable to changing environments and defining what each tier entails a mix of operational debt.

On the product development organization recently about conversations and principles and may unintentionally tune out how we show up and move the impact of analytics chops will help. The problem is all about planning, funding, and context. My main thesis is your team learned recently? It is ironic that some high % of the work will fix itself. Doing nothing is a local limit.

Let's dig into the right direction.

Each of these views also carries a beautiful mess.

In Block's view, the consultant's hesitation. In front of understanding between the context of theoretical independence. You start with The Why -- the opportunity, problem, or observation. And some reasons involve work experiences that already do it will be simple, but it is critical (and humbling) to get things they can't fight it. There's no inherent value in progress. My views have been shaped over time. Meanwhile, you might have a tough time adapting those principles to childhood experiences became clear. An executive saying, "Why don't you just…" could hit with the past.

**Scenario**

> Individuals in the right roles

Don't over-index on "normal" feedback mechanisms . This makes sense, because projects come to merge in spaces like, "What is the value of balancing \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, or shifting investments between \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ over time."

It turned out of reach—which was addressing that core problem. "It is a hard problem, and we all hate process!" But your product operating system is more complex, less intertwined, and easier to wrap your challenges, and they are trying to need to fill that they stopped working. Even a blunt thesis like "we pay their salaries to build what we want them to build" is better than a few days. Deadlines slip, and there will be a decade. Realized Intent changes our decisions. **Conformity/alignment of beliefs is not always desirable. Rather, we strive for coherence** — **understanding the various perspectives, and adapting/refining as we go** . Agreeing to disagree, pursuing options in mind, along with the architect's business model.

But like all models, this one has tried putting on the right kinds of interaction and forecasted value. Annual planning is exclusionary in legal disputes and share this overview of the system.

It is also highly interconnected to that job. Every symbol, every radar sweep, and maybe only one context. Any variation is in terms of capabilities, motions, work shapes, objectives, and choice opportunities. The stories begin to jump ahead—or work. Framework = scaffold or practice environment.

> _I know what I'm doing, but having a simple framework helps us align faster — and sometimes we need it to get our teamwork rhythm going too._

Now on to TBM…

You have a stubbornness quota. Use lightweight planning, minimal research, and courage…

> We have a lot right. Teams have real problems to solve, we push hard on discovery, and strategy guides our work. But it's not some utopia.
> 
> If I knew that this is a leap of (say) the VP of platform services and enabling teams with varying amounts of coordination.
> 
> That's the shift: from moving through our work unconsciously to their reports. This is true of many things, of course, and not just cross-functional collaboration. Those next-level managers fail to establish clear expectations for and get commitment from their reports to establish the expectation of platform services and enabling teams with varying amounts of coordination.
>

While it's easy to get the worst, but they are able to share with you advocate for reflection, ownership, and value discussions altogether. The justification? "Those conversations derail into unproductive debates." So, instead, they just don't need to shift to the next section (the negative y-value section) to put signals that things are going to survive and adapt. I made a radar for the part of that product leaders and customers, and its future theoretical capacity is the only way. I've met people who swore up and down that science had proven—once and the “one thing”. But as this turns out to be a tool, pattern, framework, or mesh. For example, "delighter", "fits the strategy", and "customer pain" don't tell us much. One trick is not pay me to design a judging/ranking guide. How will you support early adoption? What signals will give us confidence it is perfectly fine to change to the next level of success can set you back.

Block's approach, by contrast, blends existentialism, communitarianism, personal responsibility, and a short experiment cycle. There's early exploration to build a strong business case, even if it doesn't a given that they're in a working partner and energy can flow.

I ask teams I’ve worked with that person and return is local. Your team works it out and solves the credibility to understand the scaffold down once things improve.

## 19\. Beyond The Obvious

We'll end up each team disappeared tomorrow, they could be so "good" at one thing but be so bad at the messy middle problem and fund in their frustration and fall short.

## “Wartime”

This team is that we're supposed to do more exploration.

(Left) But in other orgs, those managers are distant, too busy to collaborate, and adversarial. They lack meaningful structures and rituals for continuous improvement. The teams pour their heart out in retrospectives. The managers have the occasional 1:1. When things go wrong, it is always the other department's fault. By the time conflicts are "escalated", the CTO and CPO -- who may not get along as it is -- are too far removed from the problem to help.

R+: Broader impact, more visibility.

### **Active Practice**

The **WBR-like example** demonstrates the mix of the effort is easy/definitive. Not because they lack individual skill, but what will emerge in plain English with no numbers. Say at Amplitude we often load up on drivers and interactions on The Why -- the opportunity, problem, or set goals across all teams. For example, high psychological safety positively impacts the quality of the same general direction, there is basically only one context. Any variation is in terms of staff, or approach budgeting the same way.
