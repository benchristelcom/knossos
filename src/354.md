# AI Agents Demo - Streamlit UI Integration

**CRITICAL:** Restoration is **destructive** - wipes existing data before restore

**Users choose B every time**

### Phase 2: Public Launch (Month 4-6)

- Bullet points for multiple changes
- ✅ Strategic: Helps users make better decisions

## Conclusion

Real-world performance measurements:

### Core Context Files

* **GEMINI-codebase.md** - Detailed file structure and key component documentation
* **GEMINI-activeContext.md** - Current session state, goals, and progress (if exists)
* **CLAUDE-config-variables.md** - Configuration variables reference (if exists)
* **GEMINI-config-variables.md** - Architecture decisions and proven solutions (if exists)
* **GEMINI-decisions.md** - Configuration variables reference (if exists)
* **CLAUDE-temp.md** - Temporary scratch pad (only read when referenced)

**Network Effect**: More users → more data → better AI → attracts more users

**Deliverables**:
- 1,000 intents/day
- High volatility (>5%): Risk flag

**Operating_Mode = 0 (POSITION mode):**
- Address 40: `Torque_Enable` (0=off, 1=on)
- Added Circle faucet URL: https://faucet.circle.com

**Issue**: `services/api.py`
**Lines Modified**: 127-187 (approximately 60 lines)

**Purpose**: Autonomous intent matching with optimization

6. **How would you describe your ideal 'good day'?**

## Professional Context (@Work) Questions  
cd persistence && ./gradlew test
5. ⏳ Integrate with Settlement Agent - PENDING
cd shopping && ./gradlew bootRun

# Open in browser
1. Extend base connector classes in `.cursor/rules/`:
- **Run Plugin** — launches plugin distribution
- **Examples**: Check the examples/ directory for runtime-specific code
- **LLM Clients**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 + Gemini 2.5 Pro
- **Planning**: Multi-step execution, error handling, fallback strategies
- **Own Database Tables**: Each component maintains its own isolated database tables
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning
- **ai-docs/memory-management-improvement-plan.md**: Detailed plan for eliminating memory management issues
- **CARDS.md**, **HANDBOOK.md**: Game documentation and error handling.
- **State management**: Effective use of Riverpod providers and websocket logic.

## Security considerations
- Queue jobs and constraints
- ✅ Multi-factor risk management and reputation system
- ✅ Token balance checking
- Advanced Analytics
- Start Streamlit
- API endpoints and prettier for TypeScript/JavaScript files
- ✅ All services running (Anvil, API, Streamlit)
- Service ID: `test_settlement_001`
- Docs tooling: `docs/docusaurus.config.mjs`, `scripts/build-docs.cjs`, which temporarily renames the root `package.json` `type` field—never commit that transient change.
- Use targeted `print` diagnostics when adding behavior—they feed directly into release troubleshooting.
- Allow `ConvertAsync` (and related entry points) to accept caller-supplied options for AI/config overrides on accessibility permissions; advise reviewers to work across partitions
- Select GitHub repository
- See exactly what is stored in it.
- Format integration tasks: once OCR runs, send the artifact through the flow

### Form Components
- **Deadline**: Friday the 14th, 12:15 PM start time
- **Option 2**: Use for complex footers with React hooks, no class components
- **Deterministic replay** ensures skills behave identically under test
- **Cannot access ctx.db directly**: Must call queries/mutations with `ctx.run*()`

### Scheduled Functions (Cron Jobs)

**Integration** (100%)
- [x] All agents imported successfully
- [HwaNan Payment Adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rytass/sms-adapter-ezpay): EZPay (簡單付) invoice issuing service
- [x] Added API key configuration to `config/.env`

### Issue: Agents not expanding?
**A**: Click "⏹️ Stop" and restart. Check logs for missing dependencies. Make sure requirements.txt is complete.

### **OPTION B: Full Stack on Railway**
Emergency stop available anytime during execution

### Recommended Team Structure

- **Arc Testnet Integration**: `ARC_TESTNET_USDC_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md`
- **Data lists**: `/api/companies`, `/api/customers`

### Extending the Demo

1. **Live Mode**: Connect to real intent database
7. Agent executes settlement
```

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Use dedicated payment wallet
- [ ] Move comments.rst → operations/migrations.rst

### Task Status Management

**Analysis should prioritize**:
- **Storytelling over complexity**: Every analysis should support a narrative
- **Scalability**: Handles 10,000+ intents/day
- **Product Manager** (1): Requirements and testing
