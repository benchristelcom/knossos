# Arc Coordination System - Agentic AI COMPLETE ✅

**Consider Phase 3+**
- Only if proven value
- File: `services/agents/risk_agent.py` (340 lines)
- **Builder Patterns**: `/configuration/src/builder/` (agent.ts, graph.ts)
- **Purpose**: Monitors inbox for job execution

## Project Overview

- **Deployment Location**: Always run docker-compose commands from `outputs/` directory
- **Main branch**: `main`
- **Run tests**: `python run_test.py` (validates CloudFormation templates)
- **Canonical program representations** (tool call templates, parameter mappings)
- **Single button**: Submit (right-aligned)
- **Functions**: `transfer()`, `balanceOf()`, `approve()`, `transferFrom()`
- Color palettes are defined in `build/` directory
- Frontend routing (Vue Router)
- Correctly raised `ValueError`
- Description: "Test settlement service"
- All required fields present (type, version, payment, merchant)
- ✅ testAuthorizeOracle
- Used for: Matching, Risk, Fraud, Settlement

### Compatibility Guidance
- `docs/`: Sphinx documentation source

### 3. Test x402 Payments
- Community features demonstrated
- Users expect consistent pricing logic

**ui/x402_payment_demo.py:406-420**:
```python
const generateUploadUrl = useMutation(api.tasks.create);
//    ^? (args: { text: string; userId: Id<"users"> }) => Promise<Id<"tasks">>

// Full IntelliSense support
git worktree prune
```

## Cross-Runtime Compatibility

Before implementing ANY task, check if relevant skills apply:

- Plan-specific limit increases
- Pattern analysis results
- AI Cost: ~$3,000/month
- ✅ Reads chain ID from signature
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) integration
- System never "stuck" on AI latency

| Docker Swarm | ECS Anywhere Equivalent |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Swarm Manager | ECS Control Plane (AWS-managed) |
| Worker Nodes | External Instances (your hardware) |
| API Cost/Month | $4,500-13,500 | $60 | ✅ Revised (99% cheaper) |
| Reliability | Depends on API | Algorithmic core | ✅ In v-for loops | Use indexed names or separate component instances |
| Scale | 300,000 | $19,800 | $250,000 | $76,400 | 12.6x |

Traefik needs to "find file/directory by name"?
  → USE: rg "pattern"  (NOT find!)

Need just current directory?
  → USE: ls -la  (OK for single dir)
```
