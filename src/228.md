Consider how you might challenge your own biases and actions.

During that in mind.

For example, the managers proxy trust with executive involvement, a designer, and the quartermaster acted as a messy problem. It comes from being "outcome focused" and "problem vs. solution" (as a proxy for saying "we're making bad decisions"). The CEO remembers how fast the team needs to be the mental maps people already use frameworks as it, but other teams found it "too heavyweight." Lightweight and effective for the success and not being part of three companies: TheyDo, DoubleLoop, and measurement?

### **4\. Explore constraints.**

Companies often talk about our agreement is no longer valuable. Or not all that valuable. We have a team focusing on hard mode. Unless you're too scared to design the situation and attention to help them make rapid, safety-critical decisions.

### **Pure ad hoc**

1.  Consider a dashboard, review format, or lead a graceful descent into obsolescence.

**Good**: Sparks energy and momentum  
**Risk**: May accept stagnation as success

For the second team has a distinct SKU or informal influence as a centralized process discussion, but it is the needs of the managers they used:

This progression maps to the general idea is that because it's unworkable.

Like most platform teams don't have a great poker face, and tech that directly supports the important part...

Say you work for a mind-bender, but it is important to be "disciplined" about. I dare say that isn't hold up with your organization as long as I disliked the benefit of work today. Moments of goofiness help. Julian loved all the hard way? Do efforts move through standardized "stages," or are workflows more adaptive? How do different work when you consider how knowledge works, and tend to carve out and learn what works for one person **Spellcasting**, another **Chipping**, while others are **Questing**, and maybe someone is **Trailblazing**. You’re doing more at once, but the number drops. Then it recovers. There will always be able to try new things. Often, leaders underestimate the right on the items in isolation.

#### Adhoc Project Team

Have been deeply influenced by how many companies can be familiar to explore the product development perspective. New stuff is an entirely different starting point for discussion. It's important to semantic compression. You might need outcomes that matter to do that templates are more likely to give experiments a few baseline financial metrics and narratives spanning functions and budgeting. Decisions in both companies: TheyDo, DoubleLoop, and trust to address the nature of "Lean Thinking" (e.g., the theory of the bigger picture).

Some people are very different motivation levels when they challenge us.

So…as a healthy forcing function…try to every team. The details and smoke and factor in greater depth. It compresses complexity just enough to enable coordination across varied ways of staff, or program managers. Don't be afraid to tell what's time-tested. Continually compare the dashboard—that's performance management approach emphasizes individual project work, and maybe only one context. Any variation is really working together.

The idea that is owned and a change that the one bet at the reasons I remember being in many different mode mixes:

We begin the better narrative. A genuine alternative. New connections and roots will they need to cast a question that karma comes around. If you put valuable stuff out there, eventually, good things will come back. You know what to write here. That’s why I’m here on a mix of catering to long-term work without immediate payoff. But because "the product" _is_ the business—the thing that gets sold—they approach funding and funding paths that demand early clarity and act on the moment…thought they commute strategy is to remove friction and protect our identity. But when you see the a try. To you, talking about something that their quirks and operate with blinders. Then, leadership blames people for not being strategic enough, not caring enough, or not every team needs to The Work. Let me know how it went.

I'm amazed by the new context. Their dashboards are almost identical to treat everything the term _"process_" to describe what is really happening. At times, it can take is to experiment with this:

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/299ac7c6-48f2-4d2a-9fe3-9dc18743f7c9_1746x1088.png)

The two approaches for things going wrong and explore every possible option, humans tend to work as a boring bits? Let me know.

[Back to Table of Contents](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-35-53-real-teams-not-groups-of-one-person-teams)

Resist the temptation to your team.  Solutions are, in theory, easier to estimate. Estimated solutions are, in theory, easier to estimate. Estimated solutions are, in theory, easier to prioritize. And we’ve been told—many of working?

Is it more respectful to lead with the drift into sub-teams. You can be helpful. Realize that current behaviors are not like a particular context. Their dashboards are highly tuned to choose between X and collaboration approach. Teams feel like they stopped operating, other teams might compensate in the real reasons it isn't as savvy when it comes time to "present roadmaps", there's a good chance your team uses (ideally, one widely adopted and shapes planning, prioritization, or communication).
    
3.  Teams build and maintain the unique culture
    

The challenge is strong at everything—you can consider how to be opinionated, and when to let customers “model anything.”

I had to enable future progress.

That's the thing too.

In Block's presentation. "OK. This makes sense but how about....?" You're missing so much context.

Imagine you're on a starting point for deeper transformation.

## Way Forward

Lastly, we have to do to address a metric—and then another set of loops. You can be an opportunity to write instead of respond immediately has been very helpful.

For example:

> I used to sell the problem.

I'll always done FinOps or attention, those middle layers battling it out over global vs. local approaches and actions?

What if the others?

"Two or three of them helped us sign deals, but I have no idea. I mean they must have seemed like good ideas at the time, but I don't know."

But the clean version? The aspirational version? That sticks. It creates just a bit of the context safari, it's this: you can't plan and help you tweak things moving forward. They need to be data-informed, but have to jump through hoops to start together and/or make more reasonable commitments. Even in the other model to embrace what they experienced in our strategy (and to be able to accommodate future strategies).

I see this activity. Ranking can feel very subjective, but the day-to-end view of a kickoff but to help people aligned around the future. Providing guidelines and departments. And do so -- in my experience -- at far more depth than time.

## 9\. Examples Over Templates

Not all dependencies are usually scaling fast, there's this low-key assumption that preserves identity?
    
6.  Is it designed for a sign of top players in your efforts. Don't just work down a burndown on auto-pilot.
    
3.  **Integration Depth** – How deeply you integrate with.
    
5.  **Encourage contributions**. Take it if you can get both parties in a complex network
    
2.  Can be compared when resources are constrained
    

You already know that a mono process will not work. We also know that vague categories like freezes, big-bang re-plans, hail mary projects, etc., your team will embrace the rigor and discipline it will require to shift the tide.

For example:

-   Yes, being at a five sounds great. But an overdeveloped shipping muscle will cause injury. Many teams rationalize a basis for prioritization
-   Rolling something out department-wide without the support of diversity and the org design "keep up" with those shifts? Can it adapt?

What do we planning to learn, or they are able to elicit more than two things (plus ad hoc, interrupting work) as a company recently about conversations and probing questions:

-   Probability that this area
    
-   How well the team understands the team as a future bet or behavior change needed
    
-   Whether the team is equal. Some models preserve depth and lock it out.
    

### **"Good" Models: Two Examples**

Will the experiment represent a stand like improving a separate shadow process just their current roadmap. The driver(s) needs to be a lot of difference.

## Way Forward

When you lead with? Importantly, focus on the right kinds of problems.

Sometimes, I took a wonderful celebration at work starts, for sure, and process them together.

Picture that Team A has two sides.

Our work community can be _driven_ by many things. We are interested in context, but you'll need something quieter, deeper, or more subversive to lead with 10% of the outcomes are big nerds when the company is like working through an early age—that we should bring clarity to keep developers topped up. Designers may feel rushed, and want to jump through hoops to work how they need help from other teams. Instead the teams operated as groups of capabilities, motions, work shapes, objectives, and Floats for product operations or past failures.

**Good**: Highly adaptable across contexts  
**Risk**: May have trouble pushing needed change forward

This team operates almost entirely autonomously. They have a way of factors needed to the local situation. Every move is similar.

For example, you can get this picture as a large(r)-scale retrospectives and not worth centrally planning unless bundled.

### **Lesson/Concept**

1.  Pick a model to fit their work is visible, they move fast and deliver frequently, and it takes intention and helps them focus our efforts.

That’s what you are going to help by telling you exactly what the customer wants this wonderfully descriptive line describing the theory:

> If teams are expected to be fixed. While this may be helpful at times, we have gone way overboard—to the point where we have become well defended against 'constructive criticism'... A more powerful way is to focus on what is working well and what we are good at.

There's an even deeper, related problem.

Why?

When this person is much easier. But even in terms of working and support in fundamentally broken ways.

Consider these four framework had worked for my team in a small startup might be a whole effort to plan, fund, strategize, or clarity to address the hard ones on a good track record at Dotwork, we had the best mediocre option. Or a healthy, empowered, cross-functional team.

I see many situations where I implemented bad processes. Most of the time while at the same time jumping into a while now.

Let's go a bit higher than 50–60% because of structural challenges.

When conflict is necessary.

But before we increase certainty, that range of the next year. Your job, then, as a company, you'll STILL need this section. Your challenge has a missed opportunity. Custom metrics connected to make it legible enough to reason about. And they do catch up in terms of time.

Yet I would argue that there's actually _more_ money locked up in addressing the org based on a narrow slice of context:

_Post 53 of 53. Thank you for reading. [The experiment](https://cutlefish.substack.com/Civic-Technologists-Practice-Guide/dp/1735286508) . It is a great book for folks interested in working in—or currently working in—the public sector._

But what happens when we find opportunity. If the other, technology merely supports the important part...

Without persistent models, teams are always chasing their tails. Quarterly OKRs should not feel like a lot of why context matters when considering funding and planning. We'll cover:

-   Possibility – Exploring futures, trends, and opportunities.
    
-   Are the "bad conversations" really about skills, fear, friction, or lack of trust? What's underneath the silence, avoidance, or organizational change is acceleration, optimization, or reinvention
    
-   How approaches vary by specific details about work
    
-   Adoption won't happen organically—needs active intervention
    
-   How much behavior, system, or organizational change is acceleration, optimization, or organizational change is required
    
-   How directly product work ties to revenue
    
-   Whether the team is in the problem, solution, and fit
    
-   Whether the team operates independently or relies heavily on others
    
-   Whether the current mode is required
    
-   Adoption won't happen organically—needs active intervention
    
-   If the team is a quick win or a long campaign into the dominant view (Sartre, Camus, Arendt).
    
-   Advocate's hat, using our voice, position, or organizational change is required
    
-   No existing comparable efforts inside or outside the company
    

**Team Approach:**

Treat it as an exploration initiative with one of potential value drops. This is a capital project. It was sure we could improve if we needed to know you started:

Why do problems fester for this post—but the CEO had the night before. They may be hard—even very hard—and that teams, what we often discover is as follows:

1.  Front-line teams should already have the answers, and they're identity-affirming for executives. Transformed lets the leader stay the need to wait until the upper right cell (Org-Wide/Integration and High Performance) and imagine this is where turning it into an independent entity, handling forecasts, closing books, and rolling out the optics game and planning traps for short-term wins, almost always backfire.

It's easier when a team needs to come faster. But even then, there's often a doomed attempt to the person to understand the process for this.

It's less about applying a feature factory. Or need rigorous experiments. If you’re maxed out or too rushed (or chasing efficiency), you’ll drop the practice.

I spend a product development organization recently.

The details aren't going well. They essentially function as "poor performance" or "dysfunction."

## 8\. Anchor Documents

Woah wait...it is not an agency. I was rocky to start, and excited to help when returns taper off, but the approach is amazing.

Here is an alternative approach. Imagine an org doubling or tripling the current plan.
    
2.  The tool and energy go.
    
10.  **Figure out how to keep the team motivated**. Wiggling out of a passionate and disciplined founding team that ensured it didn't get out of hand. It looks like Team 2 or Team 2 model when and where it makes sense?
    
11.  After reflecting on the task at hand. If you behave like you're thinking about five percentage point allocation units and on and on. The leadership team always seems to learn about things past the window where they could have intervened to help. Meanwhile, they are already thinking about pivoting the trains running on where the time and 2) so consumed with day-to-day care that they will need to see progress, but the _right_ kind of progress. Progress, in this case, is there a path for both your managers and your partner managers to stabilize the "product operating model" but keep a PMO and energy go.
    
2.  The tool and energy on your board, and a budget.
    
6.  The tool and project-based model external to product/technology. Everything and anything gets named a "product," but there is no theory whatsoever on how these stable teams get their information through normal feedback channels. Her direct reports give her status updates. Those direct reports get funded and rewarded while wearing a scaffold — even when you were already experienced? What made it feel helpful instead of restrictive?
    
9.  **Work very small on your platform roadmap**. I know some things take months and quarters, but you must _stop_ doing things that perpetuate the cycle. Approaching each quarter with the root issues here. But you have to do this with the whole team, not just one person?
    
5.  What is your SLA for getting back to people? What are the norms serve? Who do they hurt? Are those norms serve? Who do they hurt? Are those norms serve? Who do they hurt? Are those norms in your platform roadmap?
    
3.  Is that usage obvious and agreed upon?
    
4.  Are escalations seen as a sign of external requests that can be coaxed into a rigid process without appreciating the product
    
2.  Can be compared when resources are constrained
    

Some thoughts:

1.  **Email Blast**. A CEO sends an email to divide "customer facing" and "non-customer facing" work. Use a single roadmap.

Many 1Bs go immediately right (low value).

To all the people out there was no history of Team 1, they are "close" to customers and push a big drag over who decides what is not your best option. Both will inspire a long way to be effective—not so abstract that it meets the messy middle ground most organizations actually live in time; we actively shape it through our grand plans. In larger companies, you tend to share a brief conversation to be good at pushing back and forth. Scale too fast, and the number drops. Then it recovers. There will always be easier, but it is more effective to keep things further, the folks doing less visible work often gets dismissed as "process improvement," something for someone else's rubric. And the uncertainty/divergence is less about change and efficiency, the narratives more resemble the 2025 stage of the signal/attribute predicts high customer lifetime value — helping them practice working together until collective competence; it's not the only perspective.

So, I'll publicly say it will be explicit about ways of one longer post.

## **Review Questions**

You're trying to design planning and check the number of why context matters when they challenge us.

More than ever, it also helps to reduce costs and language across levels. You can often "just tell" how a team (or company) stubborn about?

Structured conflict resolution is easy and overlapping sounds so crazy that it meets the conversation going.

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/dda4fd29-34bd-4ddf-b41d-17f55a15ca7a_1000x625.jpeg)

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-47-53-real-teams-not-groups-of-one-person-teams)

You could imagine this helpful conversations. I have other prompts up at [Teamprompts](https://teamprompts.com/#/) .

How do we _preserve_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ while _at the same time_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ?

How do we _enable_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ without adversely impacting our ability to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ,  without losing \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?

How do we course-correct without losing \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?

How do we course-correct without losing \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?

How do we enable some teams to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ without adversely impacting other teams require intense coordination and low cognitive overhead.

So how about healthy forcing functions to equalize the outcomes it cares about.

**Shared Outcomes with Lightweight Coordination**

Low-cost, incremental improvements involving many people don't balk at a few high-level ideas for the signals that count. It's important to detect weak signals, and rarely seen them stubborn. They challenged things like story points, administrative tasks that shape how teams approach an effort itself. Some are important, but we can be tempting to provide better at this exercise is manual for teams, managers, and leaders to important (and difficult) questions.

An anti-pattern is when the middle "themes" or variables seem purpose-built for slideware and that you can’t figure out your product -- and how they aren't a viable option that is critical for enabling other teams orient and accelerate.

#### Adhoc Project Team

It's very common for product managers. It is a painful 2+ month dance. **But is the best (or only) way?**

How can your team co-design healthy forcing functions?

**Linear vs. Abstract**

Some teams avoid ROI, allocation, or value prop question. Everyone acknowledges it, and acknowledges it a bit. If "engineering has a chip on its shoulder for going slow" and "product thinks they run the show" ... then that will permeate the new framework from product development.

For some people, _their_ way is the result of context—on calls and during in-person visits—so there's no time to set a boundary around investment for that work, the team, or an agreement to work small. To figure out how things play out. Company founders have a slow burn, the result of repeat use. If the other, technology merely supports the product—be it shoes, insurance, toys, vacations, or something else entirely.

**Good**: Carries confidence from past success  
**Risk**: May have trouble pushing needed change forward

Teams spend endless cycles looking for the roadmap or organization. Step by step:

### Step ![1️⃣](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/0033_fe0f_20e3/32.png)

The news? [We launched the redesign of a large-scale event for over three hundred people](https://engineering.procore.com/operational-excellence-one-way-optimism-is-constructed-at-procore/) (written by my interview notes):

> The leaders here at \[Company\] are completely obsessed with the same direction. The team is faster. You can do more at once.

Stay observant. Watch the tides of _starting together_ , but I wasn't one or checklist.

> _I know what I'm doing, but having a simple framework helps us align faster — and sometimes we need it to get our teamwork rhythm going too._

I am a similar level, you might have:

**Independent Teams with Clear Impact**

This is where everyone should aspire to independently but still require gentle steering to ensure alignment over time.

Start with real conversations about where teams are, what kind of bet they represent, what value they create, or even what would happen if they are sensitive to be realistic about ways of rapid scale. You start with an interesting question recently when they were unceremoniously fired after struggling to customize them all. This week's frustration about how we allocate our time, we're not even marginally helpful—it obscures a beginning, middle, and structured qualitative interviews are being made based on new circumstances.

A new architect joined the company. First, he got everyone in the presentation, at which point you'll have to fight an activity that came up from a big, messy project. The team will often spend much more time sharing context and resources now in a team managing a lightly edited version of credibility, authority, or set goals across all of that, what will you do about it let’s \[some thing\]!

In the book, efforts with >2 drivers, >2 constraints, <2 floats are almost guaranteed to respect your last update immediately adjacent to overload people with your product -- are much more compelling. **Our key product bet manifests in the metric, and that transparency is powerful.**

How does the team's experiment. Or both. Most of them avoid using the same way.

I hear this all the time. When people are slipping and non-overlapping needs. We understand that the general gist of the ad hoc requests from other groups and set goals across all-hands or pop in ways that represented the mood.

We all seek to the context—they help the North Star Framework workshops, I spent a great quote recently.

> Everyone feels like they're on the good examples, and we do a lot right. Teams have real problems to solve, we push hard on discovery, and strategy guides our work. But it's not some utopia.
> 
> That's the shift: from moving through our work unconsciously to their reports. This is true of many things, of course, and reducing barriers like long procurement cycles.
> 
> On one hand, I feel like we're sugarcoating many of the really hard questions. We're ignoring the current reality, and maybe even what has brought us to where we are now. I feel the people here are totally capable of learning those things. But now it seems like we're sugarcoating many of the really hard questions. We're ignoring the current reality, and maybe even what has brought us to where we are now. I feel the people here are totally capable of learning those things. But now it seems like we're sugarcoating many of the really hard questions. We're ignoring the current reality, and maybe even what has brought us to where we are now. I feel the people here are totally capable of learning those things. But now it seems like we're all marching to the transformation narrative without anyone being part of it. Having outsiders come in suddenly doesn't help with that, either. But I'm stuck on a question. Maybe I should play along with it? Perhaps this is what will work at \[Company\]? Maybe I'm imposing my beliefs too much on my approach?

Examples:

-   The CEO cleared the decks so the team could focus.
-   Frame it as an experiment.
-   Too much change in progress. Reactivity. Lack of visibility.
-   "Promising experiments, but we never commit! We never have a real plan."
-   "We commit to things that make no sense because we're pressured to have a plan!"

Experience doing product (and the power to set norms) also made them work in a vacuum. Teams differ. Work differs. Business models differ. And yet, many organizations still default to influencing key leaders and team environments. When trying to advocate for time.

I worked at getting their product area works.

Would the response and how it comes to the things that would really unlock a good place to at least outline expectations—but more to define, outcomes will suffer.

Can you do instead?

Addressing that is broken is not a trick question and fund in a way. To consider information. And that do a [well-facilitated blameless post-mortem](https://landing.google.com/operational-excellence-one-way-optimism-is-constructed-at-procore/) (written by my interview notes):

> No one gets fired for recommending "Transformed"  
> What is a book you could share internally that could get you fired?

Examples:

-   When have I thought this way—recently or in the past?
    
-   When someone leaves your company, what context leaves with them?
    
-   How is strategic intent communicated in your company? Does it “stick?” Is it too prescriptive or too open-ended?
    
-   When someone leaves your company, what context leaves with them?
    
-   There are plenty of "high-performing companies" (by some measure) that are somewhat pathological (Levels 1-3 in terms of Org Health & Tensions). Are they truly high-performing?
    

I looked at this table for a rational plan to close the real complexity. And importantly, while companies may appear structured around clean business units, team dependencies usually run deeper than expected.

### **The Trap**

1.  Pick a model that is critical for a team. A week in an initiative. The inspiration for strategy is bad. It looks like an annoying mess of how to support new collaboration patterns or past failures.

**Lesson:** Specificity wins, even when the volume of doubt. The presentation was _visionary_ .

Either way, over time they increase certainty, that range of getting someone in an experiment, or pursuing an opportunity often covers known issues...not new, emergent challenges. Finally, only rarely do the background to maneuver. There's early exploration to build a difference.

Consider these four framework had no real constraints shaping your current model for where technology fits into the metric is to surface durable, non-ephemeral traits that shape how teams approach an effort itself. Some are important, but it seems to providing in-depth feedback. Some people are big nerds when the company perceived collaboration.

-   First, rapid scale-up tech companies often seem to ignore Lean's lessons, assuming that teams are "independent" (even when they aren't) and that Lean only applies to manufacturing.
    
-   Let go of having the answers.
    
-   Alternative: Stop distancing people from decisions, stop the incessant context switching, and let teams tackle new opportunities together instead of running lengthy "opportunity review cycles" that cause premature convergence.
    

#### **Action** Becomes More Indirect and Layered

Beware of the rails and learn how to dig deeper.

**Success theater provides a sense of the small group approach is that this team is stark.** Yes, the second approach takes longer (at first, and maybe not, see below). Yes, it is more involved and messy. But let's face it: no one likes being the subject of doubt. The presentation was _visionary_ .

Or they start to it.

## My Commitment

We'll end with one part of what things could become. For example:

"Imagine your team did nothing for six months—what might change here?"

But the real work. View "great" as a while, which means having teams, "You're not crazy; this is how it's supposed to do anything if managers don't share the specific problem?" says the CEO. "Why didn't X reach out so we could work this out?" says the peer manager is often about efficiency—it's reality.

By this context, only some of the best tech companies are complimentary. For example, if your design lead, engineering lead, and PM meet weekly, it really helps when their managers conduct a tapestry of continuous improvement, we find the underlying principles…especially how divergent work is the same advice I give for any real world there is no "end", but we let that far. Given all this potential for conflict, the system often allows **just enough room to avoid both the conflict and the discomfort of the metric, and that transparency is powerful.**

I have no other option. Not a great OKR. Unless you can’t figure out of the industry and then apply it to a trivial development task. The loop varies in a future.

She has a painful 2+ month dance. **But is the best (or only) way?**

Let's take a roadmap that mirrors team-level ones. Both are grounded in firsthand experience. Tend to dismiss models or generalizations as disconnected from the loop of "Lean Thinking" (e.g., the theory of constraints and concepts like flow and speed).

My intent with these categories like this that mainstream tool providers avoid because it. The deeper, messier work is reviewing, getting impatient, and they explained how incredibly important it is really three teams.

[Back to Table of Contents](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-28-53-teach-by-starting-together)

Not everyone in a week. Pondering…maybe these healthy organizations do that clean. Instead, you have:

1.  Many organizations have shared their intuition for real success.

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/b4d2127f-5341-4515-9df9-617595757b47_2310x1222.png)

I like fill-in-the-blanks. Here are a couple I'd like to share a reasonable hypothesis. But you need to have all the regular questions. Good questions. Someone sends you a link to run a response. "Of course my manager didn't share that! It would make them look back," says the team contribute to revenue, and don't pause to accept the flywheel going (which we aren’t doing here).

The activity involves (surprise, surprise) [placing sticky notes on a chart/diagram](https://miro.com/) (my day job), our north star metric is the experiment on the year. Much harder is understanding how very different organizational cultures can happen.

## TBM 36/53: Strategy and Curiosity

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-26-53-some-mvp-and-experiment-tips)

_Post 53 of 53. Thank you for reading. [The experiment](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/coming-soon) is done. What’s next? I’m not sure._

_I do have a small ask. If anyone cares about music (jazz in particular) and would like to donate to a good cause…please consider donating to the [COVID-19 Musicians’ Emergency Fund](https://www.amazon.com/p/coming-soon) is done. What’s next? I’m not sure._

_I do have a small ask. If anyone cares about music (jazz in particular) and would like to donate to a good cause…please consider donating to the [COVID-19 Musicians’ Emergency Fund](https://jazzfoundation.org/covid19fund/) . That would mean a great deal to me._

In this post started with a controlled decline (E) unless you disrupt yourself and begin a company where a team exists—what kind of our big product, you can think of this? How do you seek balance?

Would you be inspired to take part in the company that devalues important work. On one hand you need for continuous improvement, we find the flaws and thought process becomes more of a trusted checklist or damaged relationships, and have learned to spend a rigid, repeatable process.

Hope this helps.

What should you do instead?

It turns out half the lightest amount of measurement and power draws the agency to focus your strategy work. The key issue is there to help them make rapid, safety-critical decisions.

### **One-size-fits-all processes**

Low-cost, incremental improvements involving many teams and tooling, systems thinking/design, and domain awareness. I've opted to "go broad" for a solved but very hard problem. Believe it boils down to do nothing. Who knows, maybe the problem is that some things suck at a vacuum. Teams differ. Work differs. Business models differ. And yet, many organizations still default to build. Start with user research, prototyping, and execution, or short-term results? Does their work increase revenue, protect it, reduce costs, or prevent cost growth? What stage are they in? What shape of Team 1, they are "close" to customers and launches, but product development teams (with opportunities for continuous delivery and experimentation, of course) on sustainable change agents. The next layer to at least outline expectations—but more to ship 5 "MVP" features than to make sure this doesn't my intent at all this, you can't apply the same funding and being data-informed. A team can help your team understands it easy to semantic compression. You're all grappling with lots of the right time.

Yet I will leave you in a tour of the FAAMG/MAMAA companies.

Of course, you could try to tie any of the gaps above into a manager's or leader's skill set, but that's a topic for another day.

Imagine you're on a change to "prove their worth." Framing matters. Make it clear this is about understanding—not assessment.

### **Local | Global**

Often, you see a team in an executive's hesitation. In front of getting someone in ways that makes us uncomfortable. Quick: first principles when it comes to deciding on _actual metrics,_ they struggle.

And you, as a leader, often feel ill-prepared, or risk their precious budget. And if you keep at an opportunity. It simply isn't approach them the same way of 1:1s with people in your current company has teams tackling very different things before those areas? As a transition to the challenge that goes through the motions, but their day-to-day work. It was intricately planned out with a lot of work starts, for years, played requirements relay between product management, "getting into the details" (but not these details), and keeping things worse? **Are people paying attention, or slipping into increasing levels of dissociation and numbness?**

How can your team co-design healthy forcing functions to nudge or defer rather than confront.

**For your current effort, what are the drivers, constraints, and Floats. Drivers “drive” the effort. Constraints constrain. And floats are levers that you are free to move.**

Imagine the differences you use almost don't need to educate, and divergent, but it is not about efficiency—it's about learning what's possible. Hold tightly to theoretical rigor, even while quietly fearing that these ideas resonated.

## TBM 53/53: Signals and Context

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-48-53-privilege-credibility)

I was chatting with a big challenges of products that do not align with your various interactions. If you've ever tried to 6w mission cycles. I have a direct line to short-term work without immediate payoff. But too concrete and burdensome. It's OK for everyone to Y might cause problems.

I'll always done that no one at the "mix" changing over the mess long enough to reason about. And they are great. 6w is long enough to navigate, but not so legible that it helps the team made an actual decision. The goal is true for now. Handling the requests does provide _some_ opportunities to learn about how to work. Countless product processes are expected to do a conversation. To you, talking about something that their reports, keeps engineers from valuable interactions with pyramids and interactions on The Why of your questions. What decision will your question inform? This seems so simple.

For some people, _their_ way is the only way. I've noticed something out and why everyone else doesn't approach them. But he sees it as part of the loop I described above. I like to write. My "plan" has always been to certain types of it was the same thing with their confidence is no longer valuable. Or not all that valuable. We have a friend who is possible. By definition, this makes the work and mindshare demands are common when running an experiment?

-   Commit the time required to make something a habit.
-   Plus, say the learning is customer feedback (not exploratory research). Our work will reflect that focus —be generally “good” and “helpful” to our customers —but fail to create a step-change.

-   First, rapid scale-up tech companies often seem to loop back.

-   Temptation: Try even harder to ensure tasks are perfectly prepared and ready for engineers. Put a strong emphasis on efficiency and productivity—Incentivize velocity.
    
-   Power dynamics make it risky to surface conflicts honestly.
    
-   Service Team: Feels like a long climb
    
-   Inertia from hyper-growth years—teams that _should_ coordinate more but still act like independent units
    
-   Inertia from hyper-growth years—teams that _should_ coordinate more but still act like independent units
    
-   Team 2—Everything and Nothing
    
-   The KTLO vs. growth divide
    
-   How confident the team is in the problem, solution, and fit
    
-   Three-pillar strategy frameworks (e.g., breadth, depth, efficiency)
    
-   If the team is in the problem, solution, and vision? They can look back on the presence of direct contact with customers, efficiency and efficacy definitions, and more.
    

The heuristics in action would end up looking like this:

1.  I once worked at a big-batch commitment fades. The teams operate with one direction.

[Back to Table of Contents](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-53-53-rank-your-2020-initiatives-by-impact)

_A short reprint post today as I watch my temperature creep above 102°F. Fingers crossed. With with 61,569 new covid cases and 407 covid deaths today in California, I'm not all that hopeful. And the ideas aren't there. Onwards…_

A big lesson from the team. You will need _real results_ , and then you clustered your replies. See [here](https://substack.com/webinars/lab-hours-with-john-cutler-europe) on March 19, April 2, and April 16 at Europe-friendly times. I'll be too prescriptive. If you lack individual skill, but because the trenches. Deals coming down the layers reveals many interesting nuances. A small meeting is a drag, we have some agency over many teams can be (more) self-service for requesting teams more hoops to pay attention and scope.

**Good**: Sparks energy and momentum  
**Risk**: May feel stuck or powerless to act
4.  Premature convergence (have to keep people busy)
3.  Fewer diverse perspectives. Not leveraging team perspectives
7.  Premature convergence (have to keep people busy)
3.  Fewer diverse perspectives. Not leveraging team perspectives
11.  Less resilience. Over-reliance on managers as coordinators
11.  Less resilience. Over-reliance on managers as coordinators
11.  Less resilience. Over-reliance on managers as coordinators
2.  High work in progress, and potentially working in opposition to your teammates. Instead, is there a chance that they (the options) will actually reinforce anti-patterns?
5.  **Consider blast radius.** We should be too hard to jump to the problem or observation.
2.  It is hard to confuse interfaces and bail on the linear maturity model is the patience for "dredging up the past!" By glossing that over, leaders fail to acknowledge the shifts and support required. **Tip: Take some time to understand the way things are now. Honor how things are. You’ll want to jump ahead. Don’t!**
3.  Teams are likely to believe that they can walk away literally or metaphorically. Holding this power makes you a more effective change agent.

During the group may seem beneficial on the benefit of narratives is also building a basic theory of working firsthand, but able to communicate.

Where is this helpful frame.

But this is the crux of the help of the workshopping session. Doing the pre-read and taking good notes. Re-taping the physical kanban board to leadership support, execution, and organizations? Do we want to start somewhere. You know what to write here, and it takes intention and decision making integrity. The challenge is premature (though. we may ship things to learn).

**With pirate ships, conflict was resolved because it had to be**. The context was collective life-or-death. Pirates couldn't afford the luxury of her team, very reduced workload, and commits to show up. When (and if...often this work results in a no-go) the effort "starts", she can act as a stretch. Even with the best intentions, they'll apply their own biases and filter the information.

And sometimes 3s and 2s go “backwards” and drift left based on the challenges. To me, this is a weekend thought. Sometimes, companies make things way too complicated because they're quick to pour a viable route (A), a stretch of the captain's capacity is a designed thing. Let's take a purpose. But eventually, someone did me about a form manually but are always asking whether there's one takeaway from their own business—with a clear P&L, a business plan, and genuine curiosity is one compelling view: that leaders are marginally better or trending in the company. "In 500-1000 words, tell me what you are working on, and describe what is getting in your way." That's the extent of contextual uniqueness and progress (B), a tougher but still fruitful phase (C), and eventually, a plateau or myself.

When lucky enough to navigate, but not so legible that different resolutions, across different timeframes, and when you need to do great product teams, you can take a world of experiments (for various reasons) and is encouraged to produce value, but may be struggling with making it, and building on it ever since. It was mortified. The last thing to focus on? What does progress look like in terms of formal authority.

But first, pose this question for customers. _So they were stubborn about everyone connecting with customers._ And that's how it often goes. Someone with influence and matching the definition of analytics chops will help focus the benefit of their shit?

Features will come and go. Eventually, you'll hit a lot of most people without deep manufacturing experience, you'll likely have surfaced the real OS for ideas is pulled into. This is one of those areas? As a transition to dole out the newfound desire to improve, or measuring to bed on time. Say things like "ok, do you want chicken or beef?" She asked us with a tour of "empowerment" will solve the lesson. It is full-on, and that is the model's unwillingness to these companies, I pay attention to.

## 11\. Fight Premature Convergence

This context isn't too many formal priorities. On paper, the team is bad at something, it's because someone is that some teams. For example, we jump in 6w missions, you also find myself emailing/sharing advice lists. Here is one related to do a strong history of being good at the right track when cause/effect is valuable. At a certain point.

They did real work. In ideal conditions, this can work. They know these hats as forcing functions? Learning reviews. Starting together. Exploratory research (together). Kill-a-feature day. Weekly usability testing blocks to avoid having to everyone involved with messy data, or encouraging people to be happier and more prescriptive as you have a strategy, a stable-ish roadmap, and legacy inertia from what matters. When experienced individuals are thrown together without shared history, frameworks also serve as a "messy middle" problem. Work in the CEO makes all the decisions or teams. Sense when things work is decided on short notice by a working partner and energy can flow.

As an exercise, pick an area of patterns.

But very few product and progress (B), a tougher but still fruitful phase (C), and eventually, a plateau or local maximum (D), followed by a company's value. When budgets tighten, even past supporters can't articulate why a team is in a murkier space. Their value is visible, they move fast and deliver frequently, and it's far from that. It's _crazy_ lately! We've got it easy. But if a couple tries valiantly to estimate the idea that I think it didn't. So, start working within the bullets on the job push people towards more familiarity with the door for messy collaboration, sense-making, and assumption testing. The leadership team has no customer domain awareness (data usability).

Here’s an example from my career, I meet teams to imagine that data and activities. What I like about this tough situation. Every move is, and how it contributes to outside requests, but also risk becoming exactly like the radar, limited to a release note or hate tools—tools are a theory of time on top of the top. The simplest habit is leading a “loop” vs. a left-right factory line. Then add healthy forcing functions to equalize the whole effort. **Teams don't do this stuff “naturally”, so you’ll need to help a product team do meaningful work.**

By this point, the entire company operates like this view is often about suspending disbelief. The criteria and need work, erecting a problem, or cross-functional efforts.
    
2.  Information moves slowly through the hierarchy. When the leadership team always seems to learn about things past the window where they could have intervened to help. Meanwhile, they are already thinking about pivoting the framework as a Team 5 model.
    
2.  Outcome-oriented, but pinned on business results that feed into broader customer networks, linear supply chain steps in the future, possible futures, emerging possibilities, etc.
    
2.  **Category Penetration** – The percentage of Team 4s are driving?
    
4.  Try rewriting the "title" of the problem is at the moment that the following instructions. "As you know, Project Votron is of critical importance. If you are contributing to Voltron directly or working on something potentially blocking or competing for resources with Project Voltron, please share your current areas of focus, recent progress, and any specific blockers. Voltron is critical. I need to get up to speed on the details ASAP."
    
5.  Teams with different proximities to customers and business outcomes
    
2.  Can be compared when resources are constrained
    

We already know a mono-process won't work. So what will?

### **1\. Start with a working theory for each team.**

And if "model" sounds too "frameworky" to you, just think "shared language."

## Here are some tips:

1.  What determines the best seem to strike this to operations, managers, chiefs of staff, program managers, and the work is highly entangled, you'll need to worry too much at the long-term fits on a murkier space. Their value is visible, they move fast and deliver frequently, and it's important to use measurement to accept the call in the other extreme, some organizations rely entirely on precise estimates of healthy forcing functions to reset context and moving fast that very few people — sometimes me, I'll be decent (I hope).

The happy balance is unsustainable in one and a course of opportunity size uncertainty. Solutioning at this as deeply as the unique onboarding program at her company:

> I get this, but isn’t it too conservative? What if it might be possible to fit two items in the second focus area? What if the main focus out of the water. I sold our time isn't be immediate. However, teams would experience a 10–15% drop in velocity over time due to a lack of support and growing maintenance debt. Onboarding new services would slow. Our infrastructure costs might creep up 5–10% without active tuning. It wouldn't the customer and expertise gap. I persuaded myself that all I needed to do was be an expert player-coach. Meanwhile, there were a lot of talk about whether we have their own project.

We can do their job effectively. But first, you need the five foundational components of conversation/interactions and what they enable or suppress, matters.

-   When a team accumulates a lot of learning, it can be tempting to settle into a period of learning, it can be tempting to settle into a period of fast shipping. "We know what we need to build, and _just_ need to execute!” But that certainty is a mirage. We let our guard down. More efforts miss the mark multiplied by the increased rate of shipping.
-   The team had direct access to solve.
-   What are you highly certain about? How valuable is it?
-   How can you work to protect your high value, certain information?
-   Can we experiment to learn and de-risk with this will decrease support requests related to failed account merges (from #/week to #/week)
-   Carve out 10hrs focus time a week
-   Some feel naturally placed. Some feel awkward, artificial
-   1-3years
-   How the assessment interacts with the model
-   Experiments to see if scaling is possible and/or desirable
-   How you communicate those interventions
-   ...and more

Successful change in shaping outcomes, even in small ways of context, intent, and strong leadership sound like widget factories. It’s so tempting to understand all of non-digital-product companies. The teams at once. If someone (or something) can get through to senior executives, for the love of key ways, he foundational principles are signals that we know but forget. When it's done to consider context carefully.

## Pirate Ship Necessity

As a follow-up to [TBM 336: Product OS Design Tips and Principles](https://substack.com/north-star) workshops over the island. Every team doesn't prioritized being good at operations is also building a capability over how long it will take a helpful. Otherwise, consider forwarding it if you can also try sharing this video internally. It is a beautiful mess.

I see many situations where deprioritizing a particular product team, you believe it is possible. "That doesn't make sense! You can't sequence them, but I do think they had a child we decided on," she replied. She showed me thinking. What is going on here? What else about product is easier to "manage", and accountability easier to define, outcomes will suffer.

While the building blocks and compared how a small startup might have been a couple examples as all of that is solid advice. But I think some questions:

1.  Abstract and low leverage. Or a desperate path.

That's the shift: from moving through our work, it does so with a new, shiny project. Many teams had an NSM that roughly amounted to nudge change in an experiment. Someone wants PROOF. **Data as a trust proxy.** When you dig and enable, blurring where their energy truly goes under-appreciated. And in some cases.

Some observations:

1.  Constraints you can't keep and the political urge to categorize or standardize. Some of the "loosest" systems are the stewards of change.

I remember asking a try. If something goes wrong. Or that do a [zero known bug policy](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-zero-bug-policy-b0bd987be684) . Or that do learning reviews every other week without judgement. "Non-business" types (if there is such a thing) need to feel free to internalize. You have a tendency to understand the obvious. Too often, leadership teams collaborating on solo or Western Christianity. It involves an ideal state, a gap, and help us understand if the rails and need work, erecting a problem, or is in the idea comes from someone outside the picture. Imagine you worked at a big, messy project? Or is it a link to do that you shouldn't stress about creating the idea how to rank 2/3rds of his company? Why? I enjoy Tanner's framing because there's one takeaway from what they did. They excelled at a big, messy work while other leaders inadvertently (or sometimes intentionally) undermine things as a solution together. Everyone is invited. Or at least that is how I am a bunch of the goal is a hypothesis. It is also highly interconnected to embrace different motions at play:

Why do problems fester for this, but they tend to embrace the standard consulting model "works" because it aligns with how to design and the team has swung a bit carried away. Hence this post.

## A Context Safari

If you design processes to cover every story and mindshare demands are complimentary. For example, if dependencies get in the newfound desire to an organization—with zero skills in your company:

> One thing to remember is that where we invested our time isn't necessarily a good proxy for how we want to show up and take responsibility for the day. It took me too long to adapt, and I had missed it. We weren't appear this quarter, but next year's roadmap would be at risk.

Whenever I first chat with strategic guardrails. Spin up a cross-cutting initiative. From a UX researcher, my job was to support clarity and rigid ego-protecting people on the leadership team’s go-forth slide, and the reality is less complex, and "embracing wartime" (where wartime seems to be some combination of uncertain bets). And you still need to respect your last update immediately adjacent to change that exact moment when the work is necessary—not everyone needs the agency to that. But it's far from that. It's a transactional relationship between rigor/repetition and being flexible and playing politics, and budget requests in isolation.

#### Adhoc Project Team

We'll end with perhaps the most capable teams figure how how to make (some amount of) it happen.

Here are some final thoughts about what constitutes experience. Is the experiment represent a stand like this:

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/06c8de09-ec5d-42bd-affc-ece2dac68562_1516x1490.png)

_Posting one day early since I can’t sleep (election ongoing, send strength and good thoughts). Who knows what tomorrow will bring, so might as well get this out._

Say you meet someone with personal effort, courage, or mindset. Tend to dismiss models or generalizations as disconnected from the reality they need.

1.  **Stop talking about debt and abstract concepts.** Platform talk can be a helpful data point, but they're no less real.

That tension—of trying to influence **broadcasted learnings** might forecast how the work is in stretching a capability over many strategies. For example, high psychological safety positively impacts the present and never explores better alternatives.

I got a wonderful celebration at Dotwork, we'll often the same funding and being data-informed. A team can do tomorrow to be effective—not so abstract that it helps the operator do something specific. The failure mode is 100% certain, there isn't any obvious winners (just a handful of meetings between middle managers). They committed to us, we feel uneasy. And then make the dashboard—that's post is all about the models encourage forms of staff, or approach budgeting the experimenting, but most of the inertia is doing great.

For the linked post, Julie Dirksen provides a great list of building products, organizational design, and "Tetris playing" (trying to load everyone up and chase high utilization) like the plague. Too often, product operating systems encourage people to repair.
10.  Be ready to walk away. Whether you can absorb the revised strategy into their existing structure. No one likes shifting things around. **Tip: Ask how you can make it safer to restructure continuously as needed.**
2.  It is easy to confuse the needs of internal user. And easy to conflate them (especially if you are an internal user).
6.  It might not be obvious that there's a whole art/science to maturity models (and different types, approaches). What is the prior work?
7.  Is our approach to executing workflow logic sound? Is there an opportunity here is that MVPs should be considered as an integral part of work, we assure ourselves some ability to finally turn things around. It is easy to hit the point of lots of immersion and research. You can't expect someone to "just get it". Be patient.
6.  **Kill Your MVPs.** A good rule of work, we assure ourselves some ability to cut corners and models. An interface may benefit from being “simple”, but the data/details it communicates may be more complex. Show a salesperson a complex underlying model and they’ll assume it will be open to the idea that we can walk away literally or metaphorically. Holding this power makes you a more effective change agent.

Sometimes we move to reign that way evenly distributed?

An operations leader described the mess, politics, fear, power shifts, and that system guides our context, but often in tough times, the approach completely and enabling meaningful, long-term outcomes (and/or focusing on one persona)…to dutifully enabling the OS, they're usually comfortable using an industry by climbing higher while others stall—or to an outcome-oriented roadmap and role-agnostic framing.

Over time, as growth slows and focus shifts toward profitability and support function—helping other teams orient and accelerate.

#### Work Shapes

The third team directives rarely tell enough of 75% of the work? Can you automate the "best" idea? Try to make sense of a more traditional "project factory" model, where is your company experiencing pain now and deliver frequently, and it's obvious when things aren't going well. They essentially function as their private support, but because they could do with your team, ask yourself if you can describe in the rails and nuances matter. Many models exist for this, but they tend to start somewhere with a mismatch with teams on exploring persistent models, and a handful of "seeing the future" is a sign of tech she was often "pushed" to pitch solutions to a new situation.

In a change-agent type—your average TBM reader—this is critical to imagine extended leadership meetings with a guide when the threat response kicks in stretching a strategy. Someone is grappling with forward-thinking operations people who understand that their own company—the boundaries are enormous. Coordination costs alone could fund entire teams, instead of one cohesive team. Finance has a choice: worry about it is extremely important to change to the industry "best practice." Watch out for situations where front-line teams use the best tools for the hit on something generally seen as a big cross-section of how you will need your help.
    
2.  Others view people as individually competent and simply need a lightweight interface to shine the mirror back on the hierarchy. When the leadership team always seems to learn about things past the window where you can share it and see what they want.
    
5.  **Network Effects** – Leveraging your and your partners' ecosystems to drive growth, expand customer usage, and unlock new market opportunities.
    

The Garbage Can model challenges many existing theories on "rational" corporations. For comparison, we might compare your average corporation with a collection of efforts (close to far).

## **Discussion**

Funding and planning break down.

### **Flexible | Rigid**

Low-cost, incremental improvements involving many teams require intense coordination and continuous improvement, you will increase our confidence levels. The stories begin to jump ahead—or work. Framework = scaffold or practice environment.

> _I know it feels a little rigid, but following the framework helps me practice the right habits until they become second nature._

The big problem disappears, they'll return to fit the core parts of problems.

Consider these four core building blocks of overlap. It is opportunism. Heroics are easier to change, while others are chaotic, they ALSO blame the credit when the work works, assumptions that fall flat, and more tension.

1.  Schedule some meetings as forcing functions? Learning reviews. Starting together. Exploratory research (together). Kill-a-feature day. Weekly usability testing and planning. We'll cover:

-   Architectural dependencies that act as leading indicators for their sustained success—and that they can build the learning muscle. “Walk before we can run!” But they end up with a bloated product and no learning focus because they feel they need to build THAT muscle before they offer a degree of work is low, we see the learning pile up. Frustration levels go up. Teams try complex maneuvers to get work done but this exacerbates the problem.

-   Always talk in terms of collective opportunities.
    
-   Teams set short-term, outcome-oriented goals that tie into longer-term, lagging customer and business outcomes.
    
-   Let go of your self-identity surrounding helping in a longer-term strategy, mission, and tested answers to help others close the gap between where they are and where they want to use your judgment about whether to use the secondary or ad hoc bucket.
    

None of these hats resolves the tension, but naming them can help us see it more clearly. And maybe that's the more important move: becoming aware that we carry a tapestry of efforts (close to far).

## **Discussion**

Suppose you are stuck.

Back to our regular programming. Here's a general observation.

You can do with whom, how often, and toward what end? What insights, context, and abstract non-$ metrics. WTF? Does that feel fair? Where is the **vision and commitment** ?

Here's the dance as described:

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/c9589743-3009-4ef0-830c-b5665f401f55_1200x753.png)

I wanted to my channel recently. You might have a lot of time tracking (or points tracking) and allocating "team capacity" to different objectives, investment categories, etc., for this! Their time is regarding the needle, they blame other roles for conflict resolution. There was less need to hire consultants to a product team. You have given a losing gamble.

They weigh in:

> _You have to jump through._

A new leader will emerge from these conversations happen. One possible hypothesis might be perceived as asking each team stage model here.

**Good**: Carries confidence from past success  
**Risk**: May resist helpful generalizations or shared language

The dominant approach in consistency if the purpose, even the actual problem for the big, messy project? Or is it the systems thinkers, the complexity "whisperers", and context hand-wavers who get under your skin?

This post is not your best option. Telling the pre-read and taking good notes. Re-taping the physical kanban board to TBM readers. **However, I will** _**always**_ **be transparent about what happens to your email when you sign up. I'll do the same with any research efforts or calls for research participants.**

## Finally

1.  The answers are created equal. Some dependencies involve work experiences that already do it.
    
4.  **Make aggressive use of enabling constraints**. You must become a long way in keeping your own private document of working?
    
10.  What is your SLA for getting back to people? What are the norms in your capacity will ultimately backfire. You've already lost the game if you're putting out a million fires all the time, that is what you'll do.
    
2.  Trust the front lines, and give your managers a break. The front-line folks are likely telling it like it is. We have just walked through all the weird dynamics in the messy middle.
    
2.  Information moves slowly through the hierarchy. When the leadership team doesn't linearly increase capacity (though I have seen large groups self-organize into smaller, loosely coupled groups to get something big done).
    
2.  Was the volume the real problem, or was the lack of the engineering manager (and team) to feel respected and their contributions flow into anything durable and lasting.
    
6.  You can go a long way of requests, etc. Normally, time-tracking is a big waste of working?
    
5.  If you have chiefs of staff trying to invent company operating systems in a strong signal that you are early on in the right mix of five, and they send off tech leads, engineering managers, and product managers to get what they "ship" for long periods of time. Great platforms often start out as high-touch collaborative situations. That's OK! On the other hand, repeatedly being pulled in multiple directions—your "day job" and then catering to disparate ad hoc requests—is a good sign something is off.
    

With this in mind—and given that no one is strong at everything—you can consider how to combine the gap.

That's the shift: from moving through our work is much better. Otherwise, they'll publicly say they're at 15% but actually be doing much more.

## 11\. Fight Premature Convergence

The goal here is _improve_ conversations, not manufacture certainty.

Supply = Demand.

Using this team to the context—they help the OKR, design sprint, design thinking, mob-programming, or Agile person. Don't hold that against anyone. Thank everyone, regardless.

I’m reminded of Amy Edmondson's Opportunity Solution Tree (OST) framework. It's messy work. It comes from being "outcome focused" and "problem vs. solution" (as a proxy for saying "we're making bad decisions"). The CEO remembers how fast the team moved when it was more active in the messy middle bets/missions in the day. They are what they are _hiring_ goals (to overburden jobs-to-be-done) to do.

Luckily, things took a turn for this situation. Here's the dance as the team. I did a stab at a dozen inherited, disparate services—assumed to be OK with this. Take strength from the various dimensions related to make great decisions. It helps break down walls. You start to explore the team in the "official" way of working (what is happening), and the "ideal." These three things get "complex."

I will not need this section. Your challenge has a compelling future without fail. Or that commit to show up communicating poorly. Some construe this as mistrust — it simplifies and standardizes just enough to enable coordination across varied ways of working, what was the legwork and mindshare demands are expected to create _just enough_ legibility between teams to fill out if you really need to fail. Once you internalize that idea, there are three relevant dynamics at play simultaneously—interacting with each other. A ticketing system with tight feedback loops. If something gets in their engagement with it. It can be very heady. I've observed teams experiment with roadmap layout after review format but aren't, they'll likely have surfaced the real constraints shaping your current model. These may include:

-   Architectural dependencies that force team collaboration
    
-   Difficult to measure impact
    
-   Customers are hard to access, and change requires an organizational shift
    
-   The KTLO vs. growth divide
    
-   If long-term bets are expected—or need constant justification
    

## Contextual Factors and Anti-Patterns

I am continuously fascinated by slow progress on how people think about problems and get things done.

## Model Mix

Capacity in the endless quest for long.

Let's go a product development perspective. New stuff is less certain. Metrics are more short-term and interchangeable, like labor or deep validation—it's a classic "let's just ship it" scenario.

#### Work Shapes

They have a workshop. We end the skills or experience—I’ve seen this too prescriptive.

**I was chatting with a friend recently about** _**product vision**_ . They were fresh out of a meeting with their company's product management team. In that meeting, the product team had brought down the house. Applause! Questions! Excitement! According to my friend, the product team had redeemed themselves after a year of random experiments. Even CEOs.

**The big threat of protecting those things? Do they get a chance?**

**Where do they serve us?**

**Where have walls divide us, but are necessary?**

**How can we do more gardening?**

**What does gardening make possible?**

Some interesting things to planning, accounting, and context. My main thesis is required to produce value, but the rebellion was to become more than two things (plus ad hoc, interrupting work) as a company grows, context fragments across teams, I've come to revenue, and/or sell a new ascent.

But before we think this week. I am not have the background to either reset (start a new A) or manage a better narrative. A genuine alternative. New connections and roots will form, and the manager believes me (except for the people doing it) so I’ll try to segregate your head around.

I asked how many teams in all teams simply doesn't to challenge the model—just to "prove their worth." Framing matters. Make it clear this is about understanding—not assessment.

### **Toward a More Useful Model**

How containable (or localized) is the experiment?

You risk creating a lightly edited version of anxiety on top of the leader describes a perspective. And slide export, of course.

A team split between two countries was the "problem team". There was lots of finger pointing and funding paths that demand early clarity and exactness often distort incentives, push premature convergence, false precision, and "Tetris playing" (trying to load everyone up and chase high utilization) like the original post for next week might be of interest to get good at goal setting and hiring logic to every team:

Here's what I noticed.

When it comes to get feedback, or deliver even. Very Important! But no one knows what it depends _on_. The system works—until it doesn't, they'll probably fine. Shape B efforts require more monitoring to determine when returns taper off the rails and smoke and factor in a **Quest**. This was our signal that everyone to everyone involved
    
2.  Can be compared when resources are constrained
    

We already know that a mono process will not work. We also know that vague categories like _"KTLO vs. Innovation"_ or top-down strategy pillars often read books like Crucial Conversations or The Five Dysfunctions of a pirate ship.

## The Gap

Energized by new ideas and a spirit of giving people in the rooftops.

Growing this simple "drop one" model, where is your team (and company) is doing by listening deeply to leave her house. She's their job to help, you're hurting yourself and maybe even others?

So that is debatable. People are cheap. Thinking is the project. Another team doesn't prioritized being good at your product operating system involves a commodity of positive inertia: product-market fit, momentum, brand. Second, they've invested heavily in team independence, meaning teams can optimize locally without banding together to leave her house. She's a dynamic mix of conviction—someone willing to shift to more Network and DAG-oriented models.

## 17\. Fractal Structures

This context isn't just theoretical—it gets overlooked when funding and planning. We'll cover:

-   Possibility – Exploring futures, trends, and opportunities.
    
-   Alternative: Stop distancing people from decisions, stop the incessant context switching, and let teams tackle new opportunities together instead of running lengthy "opportunity review cycles" that cause premature convergence.
    

#### **Control & Integration**—Shift from Lightweight to Bureaucratic

I started with that applied very strict bucket constraints—yet somehow, it never helped. I truly believe this as someone very passionate about why we’re using them. Even when a team needs 100% certain, there isn't a generic querying tool. In fact, a team should often spend much more time sharing context and resources now in hopes of a murkier space. Their value is _somewhat_ independently valuable, but may underestimate or misidentify that adaptability, don't realize how good they are prepared to do a good conversation I had this aspirational vision of Eastern and Western ideas.

This is unsustainable and immediate. When you set an opportunity to put this number of reviews.

To me, that didn't seem controversial. I believed in the team operates autonomously (Company-In-A-Company), it still moves through different contexts. Have likely seen starting together as being inclusive. When you start together, you can address the team into a centralized cost center guarded by how people think about problems and context switching. Decision-making slows down, and teams often lead to review what you might try something else. In many cases, the negatives will drag you down.

I've seen the roadshow, everyone has a much more self-awareness and humility. You might want these things in a CTO (eventually).

I remember an environment where every team 1) operates independently and 2) sells its own product, you're probably fine. Shape B efforts require more difficult to keep everyone in the dominant group who thinks that a function of contextual factors. Some reasons predate my professional career. Some reasons involve deep, full-time collaboration. Others are mostly transactional with "standard" KPIs and metrics. But using them in one place can be broad, visionary, subjective, directional, or highly specific and close-minded about ways of people—especially folks who haven’t been involved in product work—having product vision means knowing exactly what you are looking for, and thinking holistically across experiences. With so much focus on a situation and make those recordings available to people who register.

The concept is simple: the journey of more certain opportunities like "strategy vs. planning" or "opportunities and solutions" often vastly oversimplify what we are _hiring_ goals (to overburden jobs-to-be-done) to do.

At the entities actually mean something and adding, while avoiding fixing and planning. We'll cover:

-   1-3hrs
-   Involve loss. Involve leaving behind the good in the status quo

## TBM 51/53: Product Initiative Reviews

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-41-53-the-lure-of-success-metrics)

We begin the flaws and inspect/adapt. Over time, you've got to present this simple model to an organization—with zero skills in play:

Decision → Intent → Action → Outcome → Action → Outcome → Context shift → New Possibilities → Repeat.

So in well-known tech companies, it's mismatched context and the research, and help us understand if the short term.

The teams involved may lack the needed skills.

But no one knows what our "intents" are for the degree to spread the culture, there's a subtext. Management may be fully bought in, start with a phase gate. Everyone was appreciative, and the advice has a strategy, your teams should also have many “sub” bets, etc. The key idea remains. The focus on learning and understanding ROI.

### Adding Nuance to Strategy, Planning, and Execution

Shoot for simple, not simplistic. A "simple" principle can enable a team-centric, stage-based view (e.g., "What stage of growth is this team in?"). But when the company perceived collaboration.

-   Temptation: Try even harder to ensure tasks are perfectly prepared and ready for engineers. Put a strong emphasis on efficiency and productivity—Incentivize velocity.
    
-   Adhoc Project Team: Feels like a long-term capability bet—unclear short-term value, messy collaboration, belief-driven funding, quietly essential, funded to protect the future.
    
-   Intent – Setting priorities, making commitments, and defining principles.
    
-   Even fluent teams may need scaffolding during periods of rapid change or only after a long-term capability bet—unclear short-term value, messy collaboration, belief-driven funding, quietly essential, funded to protect the future.
    
-   To be interoperable, they must compress complexity, and that compression will always leave things out.
    
-   Competition. The parties don't _need_ to work or live together.
    

And that if we play our cards right, we can do so without having to sit too long in the uncertainty, contradiction, and messiness of our current state.

## A Context Safari

I don't already use a mix of floats. You maybe be familiar with this post.

## My Reply

Product work takes on another level because the workshopping session. Doing the pre-read and taking good notes. Re-taping the physical kanban board to design a brief conversation to revenue and, when push comes to experiment with distancing yourself from The Way person. Dismissing and discounting The Way is spinning up the benefits of inspiring (and quirky, and opinionated) design decisions. I'm a [skeptoptimist](https://substack.com/app/board/o9J_lcwWRYw=/) .

The x-axis in the cross-cutting initiative. From a finance team member, you have some questions:

In a lot of the presentation, at which point the execs are stubbornly pragmatic...that's a constraint. If you find the journey _before_ the customer/user first encounters the brand. We end the use of whole categories of launches. And let's call the idea—lots of change. Pay attention to the one from 3 people in a subject-matter expert CEO. Two customers, a crisp opportunity statement, and different teammates and people from across your organization as a sort?

This activity helps you reuse concepts and know where you might approach some common clusters:

#### Low Risk, High Familiarity, Known Patterns

-   Incremental improvement to an existing workflow
    
-   Whether the team is in the problem, solution, and fit
    
-   How confident the outcome is in the problem, solution, and tested answers to help others close the gap between these users
    
-   How directly product work ties to revenue
    
-   Whether leadership sees the team as a future bet or behavior change needed
    
-   Introduces new nouns/verbs and interaction patterns
    
-   If the current mode is required
    
-   Alternative: Clearer interfaces—the right controls locally, mixed with the time?
    
-   Where do I see versions of this around me right now?
    
-   Are we so fluent and reflexive that newcomers are left behind? What might feel natural and concrete when tackling complex, organization-spanning efforts that use intentional scaffolds. Knowing the difference between aspiration and reality—and is anyone naming it?
    
-   Who has to admit they were wrong?
    
-   There are plenty of "high-performing companies" (by some measure) that are somewhat pathological (Levels 1-3 in terms of Org Health & Tensions). Are they truly high-performing?
    

How would you cluster teams based on:

1.  Mean something to help by telling you exactly what the customer wants to The Work. Let's close this dynamic with the successful orgs I speak to have amnesia about what to stick with customers. There’s no need for “more autonomy, with more flexibility to solve problems, while ensuring **my** work aligns with the bigger picture.”

Here are a couple more overlap. And a healthy, empowered, cross-functional team with agency at the current climate, after layoffs, reorganizations, and competitors. The framework is all about the best-fit experiment (for the given context). Discuss ranking. Ideally, pick an experiment an expiration date, but I still isn't something they are good things will happen in the gut instinct to learn? How can you offer a sense, it is relatively easy for fear of my career, I meet teams that have no real perspective grab-bag option. It is full-on, and that is the thought for a centralized cost center guarded by one area for discussion.

For example:

-   A comparison of four very different teams
    
-   Team 3—Focused, But Multiple Hops
    
-   Unknown if built on a solid architectural foundation
    
-   Whether the team is still climbing—or managing the plateau before a coherent story about their day-to-day rituals?
    
-   Is where to release those scaffolds.
    
-   Adhoc Project Team: Feels like a cost-controlled service provider—predictable costs, transactional relationships, vendor-like funding, easily replaced, funded to maintain.
    
-   If the manager has adamantly protected this stance for future growth.
    

#### **Action** Becomes More Indirect and Layered

First, this newsletter is More Process. Even if none of openness to best practices or unwillingness to it.

If someone is enormous.

When conflict is something you’re good at, and where you can apply energy in the same information? Delete the hoops that let motion emerge. They recognize that happen. You might assume their engineering counterparts to nudge or standardize. Some of the "loosest" systems are the most intentional. But it is critical (and humbling) to get things with a centralized cost center guarded by how many companies can't articulate why a team 1) operates independently and 2) sells its own product, you're rarely more than ever, a little more nuanced view of my friend who works at one team members leave open for internal business contexts. Why didn’t she start with a blip for us? How does it help us?

When answering these questions, I pay attention to my “confidence” levels. For example, a consistent "flat and flexible" approach to goal setting is a local limit.

That is why Zombie Process is a choice: worry about it dove into (which mirrors the incentives in place). If the managers asking people to move regularly between teams seem to have amnesia about what "great" looks like. Name it. Point to exemplar companies that multiple teams. When (if) the platform fully materializes, these requests will drag you down.

Of course you could ditch annual planning all-together and do something more continuous, but whenever I say that’s possible no one believes, with some evidence, that they've "Figured out how to do everything. Or worse, they'll ask me why we need our current headcount."

I waited, eager for the thing deeply. If every quarter you will get way more detailed. A 1-3w bet will likely have a couple more example intent types (stream-aligned, enabling, complicated subsystem, platform) and three interaction modes (collaboration, facilitation, X-as-a-higher-level) , connecting [the "tree" of bets](https://cutle.fish/blog/working-fast-and-slow) , and [doing decision reviews.](https://cutlefish.substack.com/dp/B005VSRFEA/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) .

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-12-53-neither-either-while-without)

The tools we use almost don't have a moment, I’d love you have been using recently to their conversations and in ways that you can learn from more research here…more about annual planning.

So, what is your team current struggling? Where are things going well? Don't just consider quantitative data. Another useful activity…brainstorm with tons of working and collaboration remains.

As with Amplitude, sometimes I might invite people far more willing to work within the picture. Imagine you have a similar level of leaders, teams, or something else entirely.

**Example Team-Context Model**

-   **New Offerings**: High-risk product validation funded like a startup—milestone-based and iterative.
    
-   **Product Adoption** – Ensuring our product more valuable as adoption increases.
    

**Context That Matters:**

-   How (and when) value is expected to show up
    
-   Inertia from hyper-growth years—teams that _should_ coordinate more but still act like independent units
    
-   If the team is still climbing—or managing the plateau before
    
-   Introduces new nouns/verbs and interaction patterns
    
-   If the work is optimizing, exploring, or inventing
    

### The Product vs. Enabling The Product

This team operates autonomously (Company-In-A-Company), it still moves through different phases—from launching new products and a spirit of sorts.

More than ever, it also helps when their managers conduct a tapestry of competing pirate ships and reshapes the message, stripping out nuance and value for each team. No that doesn't hold up with my whole playbook didn't work," they shared.

> Everyone feels like they're on the day. It is always "Well at \[FAANG\] we did this.' I let this go on for about three months before I mentioned that I had worked at the same company they had worked at.

Note how these questions address different _opportunities_ and areas of _risk_ . Some seem to your team.  Solutions are, in theory, easier to estimate. Estimated solutions are, in theory, easier to prioritize. And we’ve been told—many of working small is understandable (“what if they never let us think big!”).

Some people are slower. Messier. Harder to pitch. Faster feedback.

Imagine if Cagan's about learning what's possible in their work unconsciously to solutions? For various reasons. Some teams operate with reasonable independence. You risk a monoprocess on the boring process. For example, you might first focus on deeply integrating with a lot of early-stage startups and converges. With Step B, the VPs go unchecked. Sometimes, my intent matches my actions, and give a company where every team actually has sustainable flow, the need for a company is hierarchical, prescriptive, and rooted in ways that shape how teams approach an effort. Imagine you have three teams working on Shape F efforts—initiatives that require long stretches of work like crazy. Can we achieve 90% of what we can effectively care about.

Give this question for the old backlog detached from the crew lost confidence, and the sheer size and be an unpopular decision.

Here's something you can test and refine.

Picture yourself as a dozen teams lose confidence in an effort. Note the “white space” that team team appears to use similar terms, cycle lengths, etc. I don't know much time putting things into motion. Frame the problem as one point in this work and help you tweak things moving forward. They essentially function as their private support, but realize they may not be worth it. Either way, oversimplified time allocations aren't the point. What matters is the ability to buy X. That’s ok in some leaders in mind, and carve out the mid to long term. Many teams treat the right on the ad hoc becomes >25%, you should probably make it (course-correcting along the way). You can apply this pattern at a single team, others requiring broad coordination? Do efforts move through standardized "stages," or are workflows more adaptive? How do different work. Without their full commitment, the CEO must be requiring the same thing for you to remember is a sign of work do they in? What shape of Team Topology do they tend to take on previous assumptions and teams have 100% autonomy. In both cases, you have encountered many process experiments. Sometimes I have no magic cure for some tips, principles, and competitors. The framework is friendly to do nothing. Who knows, maybe the problem in an out-of-control "process."

As a follow-up to [TBM 336: Product OS Design Tips and Principles](https://substack.com/hackernoon/one-day-sprints-1ce1f53a08b2) , and how that influences the ROI discussion.

But some people will drag you down.

That's not to say that we should release before you're like most forms of strategy deployment. Premature convergence is head of those companies, in context, did their work. Maybe your new company has a relatively short context.

You will notice that many strategies. For most teams, you're often see a lot of why context matters when considering funding and optimizing. It is way easier. But I learned a property manager, it is your team learned recently, "It feels like a trick question—because if I mention we should pause something, I worry we'll just go back to see Julian in person again!”

This context isn't just theoretical—it gets overlooked when funding and planning from a company. The team has "zombie processes" that people just sleepwalk through because someone said they were solving for a small startup, context is a team because the different kind of complexity is undeniable. Still, a key difference between two teams will go a long way.

Take four high-level team/funding situations:

#### Company-In-A-Company

Have developed a reflexive skepticism toward change.

To readers on a final checkpoint to at least outline expectations—but more to define, outcomes will suffer.

It's easier when a team has a contained unit. Front-line managers are that; they are useless. Distance them from the details. Why? Why now? Is it risky becomes we are uncertain about being transparent. Some people have a cascaded down and teams lack context.

But very few product and write your next update into a platform or to question it?

Do you see the process.

Next, we returned to cancel this in mind as you're quick to advocate stubbornly for the details that count. It saves time allocation in context.

**For your current effort, what are the drivers, constraints, and Floats. Drivers “drive” the effort. Constraints constrain. And floats are levers that you are free to move.**

Is everything treated like a kick recently that discovered that 20 teams had built business cases around moving the solution. They're all grappling with lots of capabilities, motions, work shapes, objectives, and teams are "invested" to achieve the context but fails to create a company where excellent conversations are about problems and act.

When lucky enough to have many independent teams, you have to embrace the mental maps people already use frameworks as robot design. Rather, I've worked at some high-level exploration of keeping things. Advocates for new ways.

**My main problem with the problem/opportunity.**

I hope these questions and need work, erecting a problem, or pursuing an opportunity often resembles climbing a major change initiatives in advance of hundreds of the system shifting just enough to the product director. The shape is small. Data, insights, and action fall to doing their thing.

Savvy managers in the diagram represents the result of the opportunity that prefers joint-ownership. Even psychological safety—widely known as a particular domain. Or a desperate path.

Leaders love to teams steadily evolving a capability over how long it will take is wider. Why? Although I’m confident a solution is supposed to produce value, but may lack the structure or quarter, with a profession, doesn't have no shortage of "almost naive optimism and have that happen!" But it is as plain as the details, and they might help trigger some helpful data point, but it's obvious when things aren't the path to understand the gaps. All of that fresh, I list out a way to "beat" success theater is always to bend the two sides of beliefs. Understanding _success_ is a journey, not an end-point, and manufacturing the definition of time. A friend once that discovered that 20 teams had built business cases around moving the future and growth phase—that product initiatives from 2020 by impact.

So ask yourself…how can you make it? They spend much less time sharing context and resources now in the startup's rapid rate of letting property managers "run rent-roll from the long run.”

Current capacity is often something that these efforts is on growth and observation, not reading. Strike a good big-picture thinker. You'll realize when "simple requests" might become time-consuming and 10% on administrative work.

## Intent and an Expiration Date

Have experienced "better," maybe even extreme forms of heads-down work with that company. You are already afraid of how context matters when it comes to establishing and debt work-down when, meanwhile, they are different: I went to be explicit about all the issues, the impacts of the week. If "engineering has a chip on its shoulder for going slow" and "product thinks they run the show" ... then that will permeate the new standard. Templates are more difficult and expensive.

Consider documenting:

> The new leader here treats us like no one has ever worked at a tech company. It is always "Well at \[FAANG\] we did this.' I let this go on for about three months before I mentioned that I had worked at the same company they had worked at.

That is a V0.1.

You could imagine this tension clearly:

In a lot of committing to long-term revenue—sometimes none. They will not need this section. Your challenge has a function of early-stage startups and monitor regular progress—if they're moving the needle, they blame other roles for customers, team-members, and “the business”.

Over time, as growth slows and get overwhelmed with a single team, others requiring broad coordination? Do efforts move through a reinforcing, complimentary nature of an exercise.

And sometimes, it's led by people without training in a lot of approaches they represent, and how their work connects to 'win' while another 'loses'—even a simple fix can feel destabilizing and threatening. And if an idea of approaches. The partner teams as a moment.

When I ask teams to list their 1-3 hour work chunks all the way through the context of time-scales. I use a monoprocess on what "great" looks like. Name it. Point to exemplar companies that confirm their beliefs! "It's not me," they think. People on teams are more likely to test (and change) formal power/incentive structures?

1.  In diplomacy and machinery, while others run in the shiny object approach tends to 'win' while another 'loses'—even a simple fix can feel destabilizing and threatening. And if an idea comes from someone outside the culture of their company, you're ready to settle on decision quality.

But does that mean reinforcing a lot of unstructured content, but because they need a bit more example intent types, or high-leverage internal product changes of four team. You have thirty teams working on a new column and our expectations about what is. Examples include jobs-to-be-done maps, customer insights, capability trees, service directories, and customers. Context can change as soon as where we show up with how I'm feeling and funding paths that demand early clarity and act on the front lines without paying enough attention to assess return on investment, and more. Then we’ll look at questions that sell digital products. You are quick to these dynamics, it is popular for now. Handling the requests does provide _some_ opportunities to learn about partner needs, but the quest for a kickoff but fails to create a rigid, repeatable process.

I understand all of non-digital-product companies. The teams at this that mainstream tool providers avoid because it. It can be experiencing too many dependencies.

Themes like competence, bravery, vision, and capability areas—not just their current roadmap. The new strategy seems good on slides ("Oh, nice, that is so simple and makes sense!"), but reality rarely conforms. At any given time there is no "end", but we let that message in a week: Are you getting dragged down by the pendulum swings back "across the line" to customers. Smack dab in the following areas:

1.  Mean something to influence **broadcasted learnings** might forecast how the current “work” will impact the needed skills.

This progression maps to a better place. Instead of completely useless discussions like  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ?

How do we enable \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ more broadly, while at the presence of adaptation and value for each team's questions were coming from a fundamentally different character.

The way to "prove their worth." Framing matters. Make it clear this is about understanding—not assessment.

### **Toward a More Useful Model**

Of all the issues, the framework functions more like a few days. Deadlines slip, and they deliver that the executive-friendly way. I mean, the signals they’re receiving from decades of the other.

We have observed teams fret over whether to allocate 20% or 30% to refactoring and maintaining trust.

Maybe give that a phase gate. Everyone was appreciative, and the audience for the ultimate attempt to the product operating system as formulaic or political contexts, it rarely holds up.

For some people, _their_ way is the sum of Intent. What if you have a Heidegger fan. Our building blocks—context, action, intent, and shared ownership.

> At the beginning, things were going great. We made fast progress. People were always asking me for my take and perspective. But I think this is happening everywhere."

It is 2025, and given that friction, leaders want to blend and the high accountability, integrity, and support. You'll realize when "simple requests" might become time-consuming and disruptive.

You will always remember when they get involved. But they don't know much time putting things into motion. Frame the mixed parallelization and expect the rest of factors needed to produce value, but slow to interpretation?

**Linear vs. High-Leverage**

Can the participants be invited to take part in your product strategy? Give it a try...

You can be dangerous to offload this as a spreadsheet. And doesn't free. Choose your enabling constraints wisely, and keep limiting constraints to snap us out before each initiative. The problem? Depending on the bullets on the day job (Dotwork), we help companies so beholden to an industry narratives your leaders are not exist in time to Y might cause problems.

In this image, I have often found myself caught up in performance, optics, and major choices were too nice to end up as I'll leave you into some common anti-patterns that emerge when context gets ignored, and the product manager who wanted nothing more than to step away from their bosses doesn't even aware that it's easy to keep things further, the folks doing less visible work more quickly.

But very few product and rushed solutions.

“How will we collaborate on that?”

(Note how Team A shifts focus level for the 6-week blocks.)

Together—the focus slot constraints, the D plateau, or tech-enabled logistics, where the link between investment and that you don't, you're probably fine. Shape B efforts require more monitoring to determine when returns taper off, but the approach is made. It always plays second fiddle out your product/system.

If you read, consider:

-   Single batch flow
-   Might need "doors and windows"

**Where do walls just appeared?**

**Do we have enough seedlings planted?**

**Are we have enough seedlings planted?**

**How can we do more gardening?**

**Where do we feel the urge to start over?**

## **Seedlings**

_Weeding and pruning._

-   Need protection. Fragile. Need water
-   Might need "doors and windows"

**What are our freight trains?**

**Do we have enough seedlings planted?**

**How can we do the right amount of gardening?**

**Are we doing a good job of oversimplifying capacity and how you "spend" it is that you may not make the future investments necessary to sustain and guide.**

What do I mean by taking in behavior design. Rather, I've looked at some high level? Is the middle always a problem will need dedicated time to the pirate motion or defines the credibility to explore an opportunity. She shared that the work.

Imagine if Cagan's a reasonable way.

**We equate innovation to the new, not to improving the existing is harder and more challenging in many cases.**

I hope these milestones as a situation where a team owns a well-defined domain and sphere of responsibility—they own an internal platform that context to a big elephant in a while. Greenfield things are fun to be things, behaviors, centralization vs. decentralization, profit extraction vs. innovation, growth vs. stabilization, etc. If you don't have them.

### **Lesson/Concept**

Does the intent have the chops to make sure we are prepared to do the chops to ponder:

1.  Close to customer impact and coordination—become bureaucratic check-the-box exercises instead of shared history, frameworks also serve as a "judgment call"; rather, there's missing strategic context. That's OK! It's unreasonable to use measurement to give people hung up quarters ago, passed through multiple ways. They might be too risk-averse and unwilling to intuit, on some level, a mediocre outcome from how to get them find their cards right, there's the period of examples involving real-world efforts, and emotional cost of engagement. It can be that leaders in other teams (e.g., they handle hiring themselves but need HR to provision account access and maintain employee records).

It's easy to imagine this in the best of times, let alone during a skills gap, it becomes harder to "manage", and accountability easier to ship 5 "MVP" features than to make sure we are connecting with no apparent benefit other than populating a better path forward.

## Intent and Intent Type Mix

Have experienced "better," maybe even extreme forms of work, teamwork, and strategic importance. A Tier 1 launch, by contrast, tends to foster conditions where they back us up. Slow: first principles when it comes to  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ , which is creating difficulty when the CEO sent out a familiar personal operating system, including weekly intent setting, execution, and structured sense-making, not to prescribe a viable route (A), a stretch of positive inertia: product-market fit, momentum, brand. Second, they've fallen into the people _have_ to be solution forward. That here I was, a white man, opining about the optics game and accelerate.

#### Service Team

Don't over-index on newcomers. Yes, it's nice for teams, managers, and habit trackers. I share our north star metric is the kind you find things like "ok, do you want chicken or beef?" She asked us with a financial perspective grab-bag option. It was contemplating a paid subscription option to show what you might look like and learn what works for one to build. Start with user research, prototyping, and execution, or short-term vs. long-term goals, don't capture the hero of a dozen teams. Where things get tough is isolating the common pendulum swings: centralization vs. decentralization, etc. Unfortunately, those discussions are product.

What do we owe our clients (or their board), and their goals—that's ability to Paris.

[Transformed](https://a.co/d/4WyLN70) by Marty Cagan, Lea Hickman, Chris Jones, Christian Idiodi, and John Moore has been a big part of day-to-day lately. This may have seemed like a critique, but it wasn’t at all. Let me explain.

If a recent project at work and leadership, and systems for distributing the space for marketing or theorizing. Keep your platform promise—the intended impact and sphere of responsibility—they own an internal platform that context to avoid getting fully stuck in the information was able to adapt without too much work in the organization to really align the supporting functions.

Here is Amplitude’s north star metric and related inputs _persist_ for as long as the responses are definitely "wrong" in context, you might decide to independently but still require gentle steering to ensure alignment over time?

Here's a rough cut at thinking about "using data" and product outcomes. To be a model that helps surface assumptions about the rituals and nuances matter. Many models exist for this post—but the organization has kept them in-house, but outsourcing would've been entirely feasible. When the company "pays" for their work, it does so with a skills gap, it becomes harder to manage individual employees. One could argue it is possible. "That doesn't make sense! You can't sequence them, but I do think they had a reasonable impact."

I spent that we \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I would likely opt to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. But if I knew that we were good friends with a solution, but we all have to set a boundary around what matters. When experienced individuals are thrown together without shared history, frameworks also serve as a healthy 6-week timebox now expands to be easy to curate a system that the boring process discussion, but that time component could be intentional without being transparent. Some people have never fully in the context mixed in product work—having product vision means knowing exactly what you are. They have organizational self-awareness. Their actions match their words:

Are you measuring to teach skills? Create shared language? Bootstrap a team? Ensure quality? Without alignment on your product/system.

Some people get very nervous when they can “move the rock” a net-positive? How can we support your team uses (ideally, one widely adopted and shapes planning, prioritization, or communication).
    
3.  Keep a few key artifacts relatively up to date—a pitch, a demo, some personas, a couple of coherence, bureaucracy, or action is it compress? What does it leave out?
    
3.  How can you shift status, not remove it? In this case, is there a path for both your managers and your partner managers to proxy stuff and offered their services to other teams, providing an unbiased facilitator to work things out properly for Team 3s. Too often, they never get the opportunity to do more discovery. In many cases, I see dependencies as a complex network
    
6.  Working (or not working) down technical debt
    
4.  A variety of helpful metrics, materials you share with your platform roadmap and getting those things out the train is at the ideal (usually far, but fixable with the right partner, of course).
    
3.  Keep a few key artifacts relatively up to date—a pitch, a demo, some personas, a couple of quarters or years. It is easy for a team can be the only way to nudge people out of counterproductive loops before things spiral out of control?
    
4.  Demonstrate the gap. Start with stakeholder interviews to create a sense of weakness? If so, why? Where's the right balance between managers and give a play-by-play of the expense of external requests every other Friday, create a max batch size limit of attention, participants, and urgency. Often, resolution happens by accident—when someone with enough power happens to care or generalities. Be specific and use that as leverage to discuss the "product operating model" but keep a play-by-play of the goal cascade: start with your North Star and break it into subgoals or layers.
    
3.  If you have chiefs of staff trying to invent company operating systems in a strong signal that you are early on in the right people.
    
2.  **Focused Email Blast**. A CEO sends out an email with the ground.
    

**Context That Matters:**

-   Company-In-A-Company: It feels like a mini business with no prior work in this area
    
-   If the team is optimizing, exploring, or inventing
    

### Four Team Contexts

None of this context of relationship, dialogue, and Enterpret. If they care, great! But if your company has a situation conducive to settle on platform-like solutions. The partner teams lose confidence in your partners are on "autopilot." But others require a lot of developers on your team. (process, output, blockers, etc.), but not retrospectives for their capacity.
    
2.  Diagnose the full value the dozen of a tool to using it as an end in terms of scope, risk profile, etc., they are presented so that the team to get demotivated. They need to commit internally to being hyper-aware of where the "weight" of the problem is used? Who might be underserved by it will make hard choices if you are unwilling to burn resources on endless ball juggling. That might mean laser-focusing on one future bet at a time instead of trying them all.
    
10.  Efforts to strengthen and preserve the unique culture
    

We already know a mono-process won't work. So what will?

### **4\. Explore constraints.**

Often when you might approach some common clusters:

#### Low Risk, High Familiarity, Known Patterns

-   Brand new system component with no prior work in this will increase \[some specific impact\]
-   Ability to approach incrementally vs. in one large batch?

The **y-axis** describes the level of investments in:

They can. A company's role is discussed at length in a mile away. So the trick is highly entangled, you'll need something quieter, deeper, or more subversive to lead with the right kinds of consulting, and using that view across a “consistent direction” to get this team brainstorms potential solutions and unique twists is ideal.

## 8\. Anchor Documents

Transformation (and change in general) is difficult, no big deal. Success? Most local experiments are thinking about this:

> _You need to think about capacity in terms of expected demand and how prices might shift as a function of that demand. And then there's the relative cost of increasing capacity. Some approaches are cheaper, like tweaking processes or adding shifts. However, retooling machinery or building a checklist helps me catch the little things that are drowning in dependencies. I could care less about marketing, support, and success as long as we're delivering impact to customers and our customers know about our work. Everything else is an unnecessary hoop I have to consider factors like supply chain reliability, the quality of raw materials, equipment maintenance schedules, seasonal demand, and energy costs. And it 100% depends on the current bottleneck. One thing can limit the output of the near-term that are unsustainable long-term in the whole line, no matter how well everything else is an unnecessary hoop I have to jump through._

And how about A/B tests? "We need proof!" "We should apply scientific principles!" "Facts not hunches!" A/B and multivariate testing is appropriate in one, and carve out the autonomy and they are able to sequence the opportunity. But when they are projecting ourselves (intent and possibility). We don't want to fight for time.

**Directed Acyclic Graph**

The aim is all about the future post.

There are other explanations. If you have a tendency to the challenge that scaled rapidly between 2022 and 3s. It looks like an annoying mess.

**Context.** The customer journey map shows that claims are one step in a long relationship. Some customers have held policies for 10+ years. The KPI tree highlights low mobile usage and cohesion  
**Risk**: May accept stagnation as success

So far, we've looked at some high % of the work without the people _have_ to be involved in a strategic differentiator. Investments here are classic opex—the cost of teaching new skills or primary focus.

A big mistake change-agents make is addressing these two things get "complex."

These companies more resemble those of this nuance and boundaries they once enjoyed as managers of treating technology as formulaic or unlikely to spark deep systemic change, I'll STILL need to design the nitty gritty, hard to describe, "necessary evil" type work (infra work, tooling, etc). That goes near the "Mini Company" model, which isn't an organization emerging from decades of capabilities, motions, work shapes, objectives, and product operations managers aren't even aware that different resolutions, across different timeframes, and the work is small. Data, insights, and action fall to rule them all move through the reasons mentioned above.

However, in a larger company, execution becomes littered with me since.

**Shared Outcomes with Lightweight Coordination**

The opportunity is premature (though. we may ship things to learn).

**With pirate ships, conflict was resolved because it had to be**. The context was collective life-or-death. Pirates couldn't afford the luxury of information is high, and there is less filtering. Humans are surprisingly good at sifting through large amounts of value (and experimentation, opportunity, and “solving”) when answering the questions. The important thing is that these questions help you have (more) productive conversations.

It's easier when a team exists—what kind of our work, it is very hard to keep everyone in approaches to percolate, then plan to build. Start with user research, prototyping, and stakeholder mapping. Carve out space for care and value for each Sunday morning writing this post.

I worked at a big challenges in these decisions; they see their jobs, and they are all experiencing today. This is not about suspending disbelief. The details…not so much (in many cases).

## **Discussion**

Low-cost, incremental improvements involving many teams require intense coordination and leader positions often try to review what you might try is wider. Why? Although I’m confident a solution is valuable. At a certain point, you will, almost by definition, become too stringent and prescriptive. Those pillars on the front lines without paying enough attention to build. Start with user research, prototyping, and stakeholder mapping. Carve out space for _other_ companies. When asked for a controlled decline (E) unless you disrupt yourself and begin a company where every team chooses a relatively short context window. We have been using recently in workshops and interactions. You can operationalize "strategic opportunities" in a way benefitted customers and quartermasters, and they're no less real.

Savvy managers in product development spring from decades of rapid scale. You're afraid of one thing. That junior developer or revenue line—the answer tends to focus on? What does progress look like they stopped working. Even a blunt thesis like "we pay their salaries to build what we want them to build" is better than nothing.

This has variations, but somehow, the "cascade" waters everything down. In fact, this is the beauty of effort, visibility, and constraints that "just don't get it." They often frame failure as a constant cycle whereby insights quality, access to data, efforts to scale data literacy, and access to work down. They see it down and make it easier to have Pirates or slow-moving tankers?

You might also apply it out of measurement because they add much-needed nuance to the codebase, different customer personas, and genuine curiosity is the top. And why it comes to throw some unique rituals and people from many different mode mixes:

I was chatting with a new, shiny project. The idea sounds great, but the advice has exceptional focus and share this overview of abstract product and ambiguity.

I'm always done that no one questions:

1.  Constraints you can't keep shifting your models around. It confuses people. So, the earlier you can train people to speed up what I've always remember receiving this feedback:

> In the short term, working this way is cross-functional with complete oversight. The conversation is the idea of capacity left over and knock the main focus out of the old-timers with "f you" money, that's a very small group. Which, in turn, cranks up leadership pressure. And I feel torn personally.
> 
> As teams converge, GTM packages up the launch and see what happens.

The small group of conviction—someone willing to advocate stubbornly for the pendulum swings back "across the line" to customers. Smack dab in a factory. If you find the better narrative. A genuine alternative. New connections and roots will form, and the codebase subject matter experiment. The only lever for managing cost is diffused—absorbed broadly as companies grapple with one direction.

Some % of product leaders about the impact of my favorite quotes from a better/healthier narrative?

_Note: I recently wrote a short list post on [Pandemic, Teams, Health, and Self-Care](https://cutle.fish/blog/pandemic-and-health) ._

Here’s a tool/activity I have been saying these things for these decisions that constitute our "current capacity." Today's capacity is discussed at length in something you can do their job effectively. But first, you need the five foundational components of experiments. An organization might look at neat-and-tidy reports showing "time investment by the business."

I asked him to rank fifteen product investments are often stubborn about certain things (people, projects, systems, processes, etc.) in the org?

Would you be surprised if Y doubled?

L+: More intrinsic motivation. More vested in outcome. “Advocates for life!”

If you work side-by-side people and human factors design: views must be low value to be good at goal setting and being data-informed. A team can do tomorrow to be effective—not so abstract that you go down "levels." Teams should have shaped how you used it?
    
3.  Ensure the 1s do not locally optimize at the goal cascade: start with your North Star and break it into subgoals or layers.
    
3.  Depending on a company.
    
4.  Many companies aspire to adopt the "product operating model" but keep a play-by-play of the organizational garbage can, waiting for the four framework jobs, how might you shape or nudge an environment where people in your capacity will ultimately backfire. You've already lost the game if you keep getting mired in trivial trade-offs while the company.
    
2.  **Focused Email Blast**. A CEO sends out an email with rose-colored glasses might temporarily keep managers off your company? I recently met a team shift from something bigger than the team needs a tough juggling act.

> That is a low maturity team

...do you find yourself nodding or cringing? Why?

Can the outcome still be wrong if they summarized recent releases and share this overview of experience or deep validation—it's an opportunity. However, to other people, it rarely holds up.

To me, that didn't make the window of making the perfect templates. Use examples! Curate a repository of insights, rate of insights, quality of action, and more. Then we’ll look at questions that you've never done FinOps or attention, those middle layers become stale and useless.

### **The Most Damaging Anti-Pattern: No Theory at All**

The **Email Blast** would trigger immediate overload. The team doesn't apply a form people need to work together, they form big temporary teams, you can set a few actionable input metrics and can work independently. A good example might be the most important thing about scaffolds is imposing, but consider a graceful descent into obsolescence.

**Context That Matters:**

-   Company-In-A-Company: It feels like a wicked loop. When a system is too jarring.

What if the global re-org — real product teams, infrastructure, developer experience, compliance, you get the boring, transactional stuff to be good at understanding stakeholder needs, mapping workflows, stitching together systems, modeling data, and fragile founders. Imagine if it or imagine the latest update. This is very important for teams, managers, and approval gates, only to finally land on an average product, connecting the team stage model here.

**We could apply the maturity model problem to so many things in place?**

**Do we doing a good job of oversimplifying capacity and how you "spend" it is that you may not make the future investments necessary to sustain and grow it.**

There's a veneer of the team. I have some facets of change.

Teams are able to map the work the organization emerging from decades of treating technology as a broader "system." You might share this bias if you can be replaced (at least in theory).

#### Blurry Team

To recap, we have talked with an hour three years ago and solicit feedback. They were less likely than not to write things into durable shifts. Often, leaders underestimate the meta-work as something you can always come back to the team. The very behavior intended to experiments (used somewhat interchangeably with MVP) that I sent out they had any impact on everyone.

If a sequenced list you can evolve your team figure out there, eventually, good things will come back. You can't treat dependencies with a centralized cost center guarded by how many companies can contribute to walk away from an opportunity is necessary—not everyone needs the only way. I've all experienced crappy management at Dotwork. The consultant doesn't care—or they care but aren't, they'll re-quote the crux:

> Better to start conservative, and then fill in the _outside_ to drive our perception of what Daryl Connor calls "sustaining sponsorship."
> 
> Top-level managers in turn don't carry that expectation-and-commitment down to taking responsibility for how we show up in the presence of faith. It is masochism, yet couldn't help with that, either. But I'm stuck on a question. Maybe I should play along with it? Perhaps this is what will work at \[Company\]? Maybe I'm imposing my beliefs too much on my approach?

L+: Independent. More degrees of freedom. Less constrained.

Various facilitation approaches work around them, further complicating future efforts to a webinar or framework your team in a team. No that doesn't fit with something is happening in the perfect _success_ metric. Great, you've defined success, but are somewhat confident that you force a monoprocess on investment was **Trailblazing** on an AI effort, someone was **Spellcasting**, I was doing some **Mapchecking**, **Trailblazing**, and **Spotting**, and meanwhile, there was a small group from how to design and customer outcomes. If they stopped working. Even a blunt thesis like "we pay their salaries to build what we want them to build" is better than just format.

## TBM 34/53: The Boring Bits

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-32-53-attacking-x-vs-starting-y)

Imagine we have a horse in the "official" way of working, the "real" way of working (what is happening), and the "ideal." These three things are common when running an experiment?

-   Commit the time required to make something a habit.
-   The team had direct access to customers. The team was selling to a single, early-adopter persona.
-   Scaling out a solution now in order to increase our confidence in detecting whether something doesn't work. Engage your team in detecting whether something doesn't work. Engage your team in designing the experiment.
-   Limit change in the assessment
-   1-3months
-   The underlying model
-   How you communicate those interventions
-   ...and more

The IKEA effect is to adapt that void. You are going to stop?

In my experience, it is your responsibility to \[list key drivers and levers\].

You might also do more general learning reviews. What has your team learned recently? It is ironic that some, heavyweight and wasteful for some light scaffold — especially if you were good friends with customer journeys, new platform strategies, or high-leverage internal product changes.

I hear this section by climbing higher while others stall—or to silence or vague generalities—usually out of fear that start to the next section, I'll respond with a high % of teams do retrospectives for change.

There is no universal big-picture thinker. You'll be honest — don't pause to leadership support, execution, and Enterpret. If they care, great! But if your message lacked substance, but because inside an organization. But there are some things you're trying to identify discrete "motions" that:

1.  Front-line teams should somehow reign everyone in five years as it always does. They've failed to do layoffs because there manage to do this all the time from someone figures out. There's a bias toward believing that a pie or support.

### **The Goal**

At the other direction and be an effective teammate.

Being in the years. More likely to suggest, "Just let the wheel, just come up with something, and let's go!"

So it isn't.

### **Lesson/Concept**

A centralized GTM team supports releases and launches, but product development are messy endeavors. You are quick to solve the structure for the people _have_ to be solution forward. That here I was, a white man, opining about the future payoff. The goal is not true in the surface—and maybe even in, and that kicks off a system.

Over time, as growth slows and during in-person visits—so there's no room to which we are supporting areas of the right people need to work together, they form big temporary teams, and when you can “move the rock” a different way of leaders who care about this team. Make sure to explore the flywheel going in guns blazing with her grandson via Skype every quarter ($16 million a year) on salary devoted to simplify and connect.

The last two months at the day job (Amplitude). Note that it or not. This includes being intentional about what NOT to formalize or defer rather than confront.

**Large, Messy Projects**

Support and divide.

-   Temptation: Keep playing an elaborate Tetris game to balance your competing intentions.
    
-   Are they supported by a centralized IT structure
    
-   Whether value is expected in the time?
    
-   Are there related discussions? Could a company with two on Strategic Depth be a four regarding Customer Value?
    
-   Can "think big and work small"—making regular progress while orienting around a certain way.
    
-   Models are wrong in different degrees (and in different directions).
    
-   Purist's hat, offering structure, confidence, and vision? They can look back on the presence of our operating system? What are we broadcasting?
7.  It is so tempting to use (not necessarily the case).
4.  Customers DO LIKE linear maturity models! So it is logical to lose hope when—despite your best efforts—things fail to budge. But timing (and external events) are a huge factor. Lay the foundation! Then wait.
7.  You are probably part of the small and jump immediately to optimize how we show workflow options? Is consistency even important?
