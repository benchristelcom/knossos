- Delete unused or obsolete files when your changes make them irrelevant (refactors, feature removals, etc.), and revert files only when the change is yours or explicitly requested. If a git operation leaves you unsure about other agents' in-flight work, stop and coordinate instead of deleting.
- **Before attempting to delete a file to resolve a file to resolve a local type/lint failure, stop and ask the user.** Other agents are rigorously tested
- **Naming**: PascalCase for variables/functions/instances
- **Fraud Agent** checks patterns (0.2 risk score = safe)
- **Impact**: No observability dashboard
- **Modern Test Annotations**: `@MockitoBean` and `@Autowired Validator` replace legacy patterns
