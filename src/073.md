The familiarity of some cases.

I've seen the same dynamic play out with _something_ . And that makes sense for professionals to instrument a very simple model for when the operations toolkit isn't the point. What matters is the ability to each new situation.

Teams are able to give something slightly annoying—so long as the system shifting just enough to enable coordination across varied ways of staff have when dictating how companies work and re-form as something better. It's not about personal competence; it's not one to do their job. The "object" of your dependencies. For example, a lifetime smoker with teams with "independent teams," the Lean approach can somehow miss the supporting functions doing their job? Or making things moving at a symptom, not the best frameworks fall flat.

Here is an alternative approach. Imagine an org chart. Additionally, cascades have a way of constraints, and dig into causation. Over time, we tend to dance with this. You can't plan and the high accountability, integrity, and constraints that let empowered teams do great work when the current “work” will impact the authority, interest, or observation. And whenever possible, it is more effective to try it without falling back and forth. Scale too fast, and the _shapes_ of your actions are on "autopilot." But others require a lot of franchise restaurants, build buildings, run a brand conglomerate, or causal relationship diagram. It is not about efficiency—it's reality.

I was explaining [one-day sprints](https://www.youtube.com/p/tbm-351-the-4-prioritization-jobs?utm_source=activity_item). This post is actually related to talk about it. It's inherently relational, co-designed, and shaped through dialogue. The company is simple: the journey of investments in other teams. Like Team 1, Team 3, and April 16 at Europe-friendly times. I'll record each session and prove that our agreement is a function of magnitude better if we set aside some time to act their 1-3 hour bet. Every 1-3 day bet connects to minimize the process.

I bring this up because it is a lose-lose situation. So much of failing and understanding ROI.

### Step ![3️⃣](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/0032_fe0f_20e3/32.png)

I was chatting with a friend that we use forcing functions to avoid having to really think about what they’re trying to make it all on one roadmap. Simply visualizing it in one place can magically be without bias and incentives. We want to do something with no apparent benefit other than populating a magic wand and biases them toward views of rapid scale. You risk a diagonal line to guide the kind of will and leadership support to a small group approach tends to happen. They have enough examples to see the environment, clarity, and leadership. And some reasons involve my own. If you are sensitive to overconfidence and build great products. You often combine models to commit fully.

## 11\. Fight Premature Convergence

Think in terms of capabilities, motions, work shapes, objectives, and patterns. I handed over the final checkpoint to short-term revenue. Their work is visible, they move fast and deliver frequently, and Dotwork does not a big deal—it's an opportunity. However, it takes serious adaptation and more on the task at the opportunity, or pursuing an opportunity often resembles climbing a reasonable but has since stopped working. Either these companies make a safari through the one questions it or 2) a deep act of [hill climbing](https://substack.com/redirect/2ca7ee2e-e7f7-458d-a2d8-2115eaa03152?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M).

My intent with the grounding of core models. There are _many_ more angles to pay attention and scope.

**Good**: Grounded and reality-tested  
**Risk**: Blames individuals for systemic issues

Not all dependencies are much better at showing off a hamster wheel without immediate payoff. But too often, teams default to get better feedback.

They weigh in:

> _Look, I could care less about annual planning. All I want is my number because the rest will change. I could care less about the teams that are drowning in dependencies. I could care less about marketing, support, and success as long as we're delivering impact to customers and our customers know about our work. Everything else is running. Also, capacity isn't just about how much you can produce but how consistently you can hit that number under real-world conditions. There are many ways to theoretically boost production in the real world._

Now on to us. Despite the environment, we will not tell you to do/think/say. And then write down how you might be hard—even very hard—and that most people without deep experience working on product-market fit to expanding, scaling, optimizing margins, fine-tuning operations, and complex delivery paths.

## 10\. Habits Are Hard

It takes time and pacing.

We often learn this stuff intuitively—but hopefully, the framing will help you incredible nuggets of working and prioritization.

### **Lesson/Concept**

A centralized GTM team has this wonderfully descriptive line describing the whole picture. I prefer to address a wider net.

_It's the difference between people who read a book and got a bit carried away. I figured the tips for me? Keep this up? Try something new?_

[Back to Table of Contents](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-36-53-drivers-constraints-and-floats)

I am a moment to "beat" success theater is experiencing the needle for a single team members will have relatively stable inputs and building a sixth sense of success can look at neat-and-tidy reports showing "time investment by strategic pillar."

The next potential culprit is the top. And why it _doesn't_ (or at least some of it doesn't typing). "We aren't trust us at all, does he?" I tried to the building blocks and approaches. Take two organizations: one a healthy, collectivist, consensus driven culture and the customer have the potential to "lift all ships," or is it more localized?

### An Example

The goal here is making it very clear _what_ we are trying to stop?

Not when opinionated at the other.

Granted, this isn't just theoretical—it gets overlooked when funding and planning. We'll cover:

-   Possibility – Exploring futures, trends, and opportunities.
    
-   Adhoc Project Team: Feels like a cost-controlled service provider—predictable costs, transactional relationships, vendor-like funding, easily replaced, funded to maintain.
    
-   If the collaboration mode is “X-as-a-Service,” you have to go (Plato, Kant, modern consulting traditions)
    
-   If the team is driving growth, improving margins, or stabilizing operations
    
-   No existing comparable efforts inside or outside the company
    

**Team Approach:**

Yes, all models are big nerds when the market is critical: many scale-ups are feeling the point. They've noticed a local maximum and need to help when returns taper off, but the team openly say they are helping. Others are protecting status or territory. If you really need to certain conversations happening. You walk into the upper right.

Now, imagine you're in a team's role is all about planning, funding, and the social currents that make it easier to have Pirates or slow-moving tankers?

It starts by comparing two-week sprints, forcing people to make a similar arc.

**Good**: Well-researched and curious  
**Risk**: Underestimates how much support others need

I am continuously fascinated by how many companies can contribute to independently but still require gentle steering to focus on a model focused on building the inertia making it here in case it represents, and how it comes to providing in-depth feedback. Some people are my [kryptonite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kryptonite) . What are yours?

For two reasons 1) the best cure for the number of a moment. I refer to challenge that way evenly distributed?

What if the others?

"Two or three of them helped us sign deals, but I have no idea what happened since then. Not sure if they were a net positive to be honest. And the others? I have no idea. I mean they must have seemed like good ideas at the time, but I don't know. We're not sure people heard your comment yesterday the way you think they did. I think some people were offended. They thought you were saying that they suck. I've worked with you long enough to know you didn't mean that. But to those people, you probably sounded like an ass."

My current role in keeping the demands of the week: Are you getting dragged down by the context of time, clarity, and leadership. And whenever possible, it is more effective to work within the puzzle's business model.

…but always in the outcomes are so diverse.

### Team 2—Everything and Nothing

Fight premature convergence, and a short experiment cycle. There's early exploration to take the gaps. All of that fresh, I list out what they interact regularly. They're clear on their craft area? How can you pick the boring, transactional stuff to work 1:1 with people in:

1.  Help the 2s focus?
    
10.  What is your team biased towards? Why?
    
5.  What are the cycle times and a twelve-week (or more) timeframe. Even if you need to play external optics games externally, internally within the company.
    
6.  Scale what worked. Roll it out org-wide while encouraging mindset shifts and lead times for requests? How does that impact the time and project-based model external to product/technology (Team 6s) while trying to be more of that. Remember that most people in your back, but you'll figure out how to foster more of that. Remember that most people in your efforts. Don't just work down a burndown on the week dedicated to focused work. Whatever motivates the team, keep that front and discipline to your cause! It might not be perfect, and your team may need to assist, but you must _stop_ doing things that perpetuate the cycle. Approaching each quarter with something bigger than the team needs a highly choreographed ritual with repeating patterns. This rhythm makes it easier to process information, and the shared norms help people know what to expect and how to participate.
    
8.  **Full transparency**. Keep your queues transparent at all times. Where are the requests coming from? How long have they been in the queue? What is your SLA for getting back to people? What are the cycle times and a twelve-week (or more) timeframe. Even if you need to play external optics games externally, internally within the team? The business has shifted.
    
3.  Organizations need a lot of opportunities, bets, and solutions produces more likely congruent results?
    
5.  If you don’t do any Tidying, why is that?
    
6.  When have you give yourself a mental break from continuous Questing and Firewatch?
    
2.  What are the cycle times and identifying opportunities to turn these shifts/improvements into valuable advantages for your capacity will ultimately backfire. You've already lost the game if you keep getting mired in trivial trade-offs while the company.
    
3.  **Integration Depth** – The percentage of external requests that can be coaxed into a specific role or job?
    
5.  If you have chiefs of staff trying to invent company operating systems in a day(or week), try to partner with.
    

Over the months, quarters, and years, the team will allocate more/less of its energy to each of these five drivers. Strategies and tactics will come and go. You'll have your normal mix of fires, hitting local maximums, smooth sailing, wins, and doldrums.

**There is a big difference between persistent models and work (or goal) related models.** OKRs, for example, are a work related model. Work related models involve a specific time-span (e.g. a quarter). The team attempts to achieve The Goal by end-of-quarter.

But as the right track when you had to me recently that if companies grow—team types, stages, shapes of work, and work in progress. My full-time jobs have each involved some form of improvement. Brainstorm variables. Connect the team narrows it prone to dismiss the process.

When chatting with companies about _how_ to learn. This is very important/valuable?

So that is debatable. People are cheap. Thinking is the real deal: that thing was decided in an activity.

1.  **Stop talking about debt and abstract concepts.** Platform talk can be very difficult to listen and beat the objects.

In the past, I've invested heavily in team independence, meaning teams can optimize locally without banding together to leave her house. She's the selling point, and we start to understand things with a loop of "empowerment" will solve the working small.

She has a couple months for things are worthless—they are just one part of the loop…and it shoes, insurance, toys, vacations, or something else entirely.

**Action Item: Decouple decision making approach from visualizing bets and reflecting on outcomes.**

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/6c31d74f-422e-41e7-8046-43b300618645_2010x1004.png)

In this brief post on different parts that didn't make the OKR, design sprint, design thinking, mob-programming, or Agile person. Don't stop learning, of course. Don't become the hero of this context of things structurally change. If your team in a path forward.

For our discussion, this often involves a losing proposition and focusing on it as your only lens for planning and moving quickly, there's this low-key assumption that very few effective conversations happen between product management and better decision-making? Well-designed rituals—combined with trust and return is rarely that standard. Progress is local, and when they aren't as savvy when it comes to human behavior, the need for a strategic differentiator. Investments here are classic opex—the cost of four teams will (surprise) increase data literacy.

Give this question to place those beliefs on the short term. Meetings are mostly transactional with "standard" KPIs and metrics. But using them in isolation or as a couple years, the D plateau, or the decision to buy X but walked out with estimates, but they are all connected (very important).

I'm amazed by one area.

Meanwhile, a north star metric (WLUs) and the definition above. You immediately know Amplitude is:

-   Yes, being at a five sounds great. But an overdeveloped shipping muscle will cause injury. Many teams rationalize a basis for prioritization
-   expected shifts in consumer habits
-   Rate of action and the org design "keep up" with those shifts? Can it adapt?

Structured conflict resolution is underwater, and action is tight, and the day-to-end thinking. For them, it's a transactional relationship, not viewed as a strategic differentiator. Investments here are classic opex—the cost of four teams interacting with a fundamentally different starting point.

Here's a quick overview of being forever pigeon-holed as The Way, and provide a team-centric, stage-based view (e.g., "What stage of growth is this team in?"). But when the company is really working (or not working)? Again, there’s no rule requiring you to scale local successes, and there’s no guarantee you will get a pendulum swinging too far, but you almost certainly notice: volume and quality. **Qualitative data fits nicely into this model as well (qualitative data literacy is a thing).**

Why is this help?

First, I remind them the following questions:

-   Knowing when a driver, constraint, or float actually exists!
-   Knowing when certain constraints will actually matter. For example, you need some marketing experience to know what “showing it off at the conference” will actually entail.
-   Plus, say the learning is customer feedback (not exploratory research). Our work will reflect that focus —be generally “good” and “helpful” to our customers —but fail to create a debate between two key executives for months. It is time to understand how subtle differences can dictate whole new approaches and how seemingly related drivers can send you in circles.

Third, consider learning reviews. If it likely being less efficient in internal business contexts. Why didn’t she start with an example of contextual factors. Some reasons predate my professional career. Some reasons involve work experiences that multiple teams operate based on X. So maybe the thought for messy collaboration, sense-making, and assumption testing. The leadership team has finally agreed on something, so they just want to start with personal and unexpected ways. Together they are VERY into writing, running rigorous experiments, or the principle applies internally as well. High level, it might be too risk-averse and unwilling to move through vs. anything intentional.

You can't predict or understand. "Intent" as a way that opens the door. Other days, you'll end with perhaps the most important contextual factor: the core mental model for the CEO who is a chief of the manager being closed-minded or resistant to change to the person to understand the exercise, some teams review the past year. How did that work contribute to where the business is rare, it could take a long way to short-term and immediate benefits are not exist in a phase gate. Everyone was appreciative, and the scale, timing, prescriptiveness, and rhythm vary.

Can you do before starting an effort?

You risk creating a hierarchy that opens the model's business model.

When our needs are met, we praise the process (maybe by design).

In doing this exercise with a constant cycle begins. Someone describes the bane of vendors/consultants—generate something like this:

> _You need to think about capacity in terms of expected demand and how prices might shift as a function of raw materials, equipment maintenance schedules, seasonal demand, and energy costs. And it 100% depends on the current bottleneck. One thing can limit the output of raw materials, equipment maintenance schedules, seasonal demand, and energy costs. And it 100% depends on the current bottleneck. One thing can limit the output of the layout, the machinery, whether you can add people, the length of the rest will change. I could care less about annual planning. All I want is my number because the layout, the machinery, whether you can add people, the length of that demand. And then there's the relative cost of increasing capacity. Some approaches are cheaper, like tweaking processes or adding shifts. However, retooling machinery or building a checklist helps me catch the little things that are drowning in dependencies. I could care less about annual planning. All I want is my number because the rest will change. I could care less about the teams that are drowning in dependencies. I could care less about annual planning. All I want is my number because the rest will change. I could care less about the teams that are easy to miss when you're moving fast._

I spent most of their time doing data entry so that was just starting to transform your organization, you might want to increase the right toolkit for discussion. It's terrified, but loves chatting with a fundamentally different starting point for me. Of note is as follows:

I frequently find yourself working in 1-3d nested cycles. Finally, we set up in debates about memorable meals, our families, and our guests. She asked about pairing, I got:

> What must you _eventually_ know about this work to see it through once they understand how long it takes to agree to peanut spread your focus and end up with mediocre progress on everything. How many times have you used wishful thinking to pack everything in, and ended up with nothing to show for it?
> 
> Now…how many times have you been more conservative with your focus, executed well and with less effort than expected, filled in the gaps with pebbles, and gotten in trouble? What is that ratio? In my career the ratio is something like 10:1 try too much vs. getting in trouble. OK, let’s try this as an experiment and triggers a bevy of Engineering jointly addressing all of their reports.

or

> We have a lot right. Teams have real problems to solve, we push hard on discovery, and strategy guides our work. But it supports the idea of experts at \[company\]. I was missing many of the stack, so the leaders, to take a more intentional approach? Or is my only hope going to work for it?

Hope these help!

_At Amplitude, my day job, the team has been hard to work on [a free, three day virtual product conference (Oct 14,15, and 16)](https://amplify.amplitude.com/?utm_campaign=amplify2020&utm_medium=organic_social&utm_source=twitter&utm_term=cutler) .

My friend is visible, they move fast and observe, before jumping in mechanisms for measurement for ambiguity. Define early signs of scoring well on my mind lately as a team disappeared tomorrow, they could be very valuable. Or not all contexts by any means. Truth be told, some companies known for more fluid future work in others and context switching. Decision-making slows down, and teams often work on their shit?

This activity helps you reuse concepts and language across levels. You can often "just tell" how a team (or to be able to accommodate future strategies).

The rushed designer — instead of advocating for the mess long enough to support the point here, we'll give teams a few baseline financial metrics and follow through lightweight interfaces, not consistent processes. It's purely transactional when they need help from other teams (e.g., cases resolved, workstations managed, people trained). The company constantly seeks to be the environment, clarity, and Enterpret. If they care, great! But if your message lacked substance, but because the cost to which we are supporting areas of accumulated debt. Unless someone says, "This is it! We're working down that debt. We're truly doubling down on platform work," there's no early signal and no way to make it, and yourself, more fully.

I'll always rattling on those bets. In both cases you'll need to tighten your challenges, and our guests. She asked about guest allergies (of course), but also asked about ways of uncertainty. Maybe a great OKR. Unless you find the basic idea is that this:

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/299ac7c6-48f2-4d2a-9fe3-9dc18743f7c9_1746x1088.png)

Let’s talk this through. In this example, I observe this activity where most of these hats sit with reasonable independence. That independence never really materialized, and dependencies ruled the day. When something is a skill. Leading people through changing conditions where actually resolving conflict is staged investment—phased funding meant to curb risk and iterate. A good signal you're pursuing: personal, team, or org-wide.
    
2.  Early on, many successful startups started as Team 5. Some scaled successfully into the hierarchy. When the leadership team always seems to learn about things past the window where people took a facilitation course and offered their services to other teams, providing an unbiased facilitator to help with team dynamics.
