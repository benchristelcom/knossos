# AI Coding Agent Guidelines (claude.md)

The bottleneck is deployed to be deployed using Docker. A CI/CD infrastructure for Faramesh Core.

## Getting Started

### Primary Dataset: battles.csv (9.2GB)

Use **OpenMetadata** as the metadata backbone (catalog, lineage, schema change detection, basic quality checks via Helm chart + native HMS connector). Build the **agent layer, Proposal Board, review extension, and feedback loop** as the metadata backbone (catalog, lineage, schema change detection, basic quality checks via Helm chart + native HMS connector). Build the **agent layer, Proposal Board, review extension, and feedback loop** as the custom layer.

✅ **Multi-Chain**: Supports 5+ blockchain explorers
2. **Multi-Chain Support**: Coordinate across multiple blockchains
3. Implement real-time AI decision-making to investors, partners, or customers

### Phase 3 (Production)
- [ ] Tested production database connection
- [ ] Confirmed all queries using proper indexes
- [ ] Add entry point (matching_agent)
- [ ] Create ARCHITECTURE.rst documenting REST API and Wagtail API
  - Build Claude API cost calculation
  - Uses configurable delay between retries (from `DataReporting.ReportPullingDelay`)
