### Service Import Tests
```bash
# Provides real-time backup to:
- Indexer (blockchain event listener)
- ✅ Traefik works via ECS provider + docker labels
- Created `.env` file with test configuration
- State persistence via `dill` serialization to prevent memory leaks.
- Implement proper certificate pinning for production

**Calling Component Functions**

1. Go to: **https://railway.app**
2. Select GitHub repo
export GMAIL_CREDS="your-gmail-creds"     # for Gmail agents
```

### Development Setup
```bash
# Build all configurations from templates
class Article extends BaseModel {
    clearTimeout(timeout);
  }
}

function isValidAudioFile(bytes: Uint8Array): boolean {
  // Check magic bytes
  2. Validates rules against JSON schema (`pkg/gatherers/conditional/gathering_rules.schema.json`)
  5. Updates `InsightsOperator` CR status with operation result
- **Nutrients**: Nutrient treemaps and provides summaries
- **Test Coverage**: 27 tests passing (100%)
- **Model**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 + Gemini 2.5 Pro API
- **Model**: Gemini 2.5 Pro

### 1. Accounts Receivable Follow-Up
**Network**: Arc Testnet (Chain ID: 5042002)
**Best Ask**: $31 (Sell 100 USDC)

Use **OpenMetadata** as the metadata backbone (catalog, lineage, schema change detection, basic quality checks via Helm chart + native HMS connector). Build the **agent layer, Proposal Board, review extension, and feedback loop** as the metadata backbone (catalog, lineage, schema change detection, basic quality checks via Helm chart + native HMS connector). Build the **agent layer, Proposal Board, review extension, and feedback loop** as the metadata backbone (catalog, lineage, schema change detection, basic quality checks via Helm chart + native HMS connector). Build the **agent layer, Proposal Board, review extension, and feedback loop** as the metadata backbone (catalog, lineage, schema change detection, basic quality checks via Helm chart + native HMS connector). Build the **agent layer, Proposal Board, review extension, and feedback loop** as the sidebar
4. Run full payment flow test on small screens
7. **Mandates**: AP2 mandate registration

## 🎨 UI Features

### ❌ Don't: Use AI for every match
**Status**: 📋 Planning Phase
**Manual cost:** $1,800/month (10 hrs/week)  
**Automated cost:** $60/month  
**Annual savings:** $36,600  
**Difficulty:** Medium  

What it does: Monitors competitor websites, pricing pages, job postings, press releases, and PRs for contributions.

## 🔄 **Operating Modes**

### ❌ Don't: Build 6 separate agents
**Total Tasks**: 36 tasks
**System Version**: 1.0.0
**Objective**: Ensure reliable, repeatable local QEMU testing

- [ ] **Step 3.3**: Document usage in CLAUDE.md
  - Extracts From, Date, Subject headers
  - GitHub Actions uses tobozo/esp32-qemu-sim which is not available for local use

### Common Errors and Solutions

| Agent | Model | Cost/Call | Status |
|-------|-------|-----------|---------|
| Matching | Claude 4.5 | $0.0135 | Always runs |
| Indexer | ✅ Ready | - | Can be started independently |
| Reading entire tables | Use indexed queries with selective range expressions |
| Relationship discovery | Weekly | No | Can wait |
| Operating Cost | High (human) | Low (automated) |

### Business Impact

Every target file must wrap the injected rules with:

```
<!-- BEGIN AIRIS DOCSYNC -->
…(generated content)…
<!-- END AIRIS DOCSYNC -->
```

DocSync will replace only the text inside these markers. Anything outside is left for human edits.
