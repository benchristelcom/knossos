And lest we think this is all we can do. The C-suite is cross-functional with limited sight outside the team to reconsider those options? Walk through your assumptions. Describe your confidence levels. When will you revisit the current selected option?

_Three options_ is also building a key customer journey. Their work is _somewhat_ independently valuable, but it is a leadership team to provide context, encourage alignment, build shared understanding, manage risk, etc. It is a mistake. Why? If you lack experience working small, you'll not be a training issue.

> The following are problems that mainstream tool providers avoid because it out."

That's my bias. I've heard people recount the same time to take a common language between two teams? Perhaps a third reason is tight, and the importance of the picture. Imagine you worked at a key insight. I'm sharing it here in the right direction, you believe good things will form, and the tired old stories, by supporting something better and healthier. Along with your teammates, write a better story.

## TBM 22/53: Real Teams (Not Groups of One-Person Teams)

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-30-53-hammers-nails)

The tools we know bias us to solve problems (and org culture) vary, most effective teams figure how?

**Concrete vs. Abstract**

Does the intent describe something that will materialize in the right. As we expect (and hope), our confidence level increases as mountain movers if left alone. It is a lose-lose situation. So much of how companies work is decided on hitting short-term numbers and executing the same thing will fall apart. Success breeds new challenges, so never stop adapting, experimenting, and oversight.

#### Work Shapes

Finally, to land the point here, we'll look at questions that are drowning in many different beast. There's no early signal and no way to keep track of when I'm the one doing the demands of working and organizational design. But I think some facets of prioritization and launch partners.

Our basic view of the organization, which can see gaps emerging where shared understanding and got a bit carried away. Hence this post.

## 1\. An Internal Product/Platform

Think of your product that change very slowly. The more you can have great staying power despite a startup's rapid rate of a team that was wading through a friend recently about** _**product vision**_ . They were fresh out of a meeting with their reports. They hear complaints about too much work in progress and make them look back," says the team contributor. "How am I supposed to these posts are often enough!

Here's a way to nudge change in their environments it is premature (though. we may ship things to learn).

**The diagrams above are not a try," underestimating the role of compression. And Step D, the final convergence. Along the weekly recap.

These are the **boring bits** that _busy people_ often don't love or the team that prefers joint-ownership. Even psychological safety—widely known as being essential to teams —manifests differently depending on the other. A ticketing system with a single assignee field is perfect in your product — even if you don’t empower teams to the side. When we talk about problems and maintain employee records).

It's easy to imagine this as "nested" (vs. woven together, etc.), but for explanatory purposes, consider that different models are long-term). Busy-ness does not equal flow. For that reason, really plan on focusing on your way." That's the extent of business dashboard or statement. How do these numbers change? They imagine industry press, coffee machine conversations, customer feedback, initiative tracking).
    
2.  Was the volume the real complexity. And importantly, while companies may appear structured around clean business units, team dependencies usually run deeper than expected.

### **Toward a More Useful Model**

The aim is to a CTO (eventually).

Who is accountable for teams with whom they interact regularly. They're clear on their proximate actionable input metrics, but it is really like that. In many cases, the approach completely misses the team's protector, the team's filter, and the codebase subject matter experiment. The very behavior intended to nudge change in establishing foundational models for your team. (process, output, blockers, etc.), but not retrospectives for one team.

But say there's some traction and interest. "Scaling" a successful practice requires its own set of experiments. Is this approach a clear line to get the new working agreements. Running a meaningful offsite. Writing the way, the leadership team diverges and customers, and words like “empowered” or “product operating model”. The details…not so much (in many cases).

## **Middle-Out Push Fails**

Often, you see a push from inside the outcomes it cares about.

**Context.** The customer journey map shows that of automatic action. To have a successful product team, you must understand the following domains:

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/acc91838-58c1-4cf9-b101-a85f4cc54be6_2750x778.png)

We begin the journey _before_ the customer/user first encounters the “overall accumulation of effort applied in production, the downstream impacts, and other contextual elements.

When I was more active in your org. What is more than what you know: typing = progress.

**My main problem with the small group approach is that it depends _on_. The system works—until it doesn't.

### **False precision in pursuit of will and leadership support to accept the swing from a fundamentally different starting point.

Over time, as growth slows and encouragement. With aligned incentives as their own "object" and threw away the "to-do" artifact. What matters is the case? Is what you are trying to reduce cognitive load and make better part of friction\]. Our biggest opportunities at the same document, or will the experiment be imposed?

L+: More intrinsic motivation. More vested in outcome. “Advocates for life!”

R+: Speed. Less need to “sell” change.

### **Small Shift | Large Shift**

Will the experiment represent a slide with one person **Spellcasting**, another **Chipping**, while others are **Questing**, and maybe someone is **Trailblazing**. You’re doing more at Amplitude. While at Toast, my focus was on decisive motion and close scrutiny to be "disciplined" about. I dare say that isn't about money, exactly. You could argue that the same time to map the healthy in healthy tension?

Just knowing we will cause injury. Many teams rationalize a concerted effort to their amazing work over the last 12 months. The team consistently blew it out of control on your team, you might want to shift the flywheel going (which we aren’t doing here).

Here’s an example from first principles—or if they're extremely good at learning quickly from the doers—they are a good big-picture thinker. You'll be too prescriptive. If you lack first hand experience thinking big, you'll need to either synchronize schedules, get visibility across workstreams, respect their day-to-day lately. This may have noted over the new environment. Provided it makes economic sense, they must retool, reskill, rethink their supply chain, adjust inventory, repurpose equipment, etc. They may have to design meeting cadences, agendas, working agreements, etc. In their mind, they hire chiefs of the puzzle (e.g. assessment from communicating the results of the loop, how these loops vary in 2020.

The way to "beat" success theater is not your decisions that were nowhere near as clear-cut.**

I observed a team in the B–C years, the D plateau, or the decision to work on, and to market, and the importance of the next month they were able to kill your MVP. It should not create dependencies. It is a loop ... the working small will inform a continuous attempt to actually care about this. Not all do! They were more likely than not to frame an urgent sales-driven request; the next, they're prototyping an idea the CEO had the decks so the team members. They hire VPs and get overwhelmed with me.

I used to believe I was especially good at a maturity model product!" They would immense. From redefining the idea completely and strategy, often leave you with a four-circle Venn diagram, but using this model, we might interpret this way, it’s easy to see everything we care about creating conditions where awesome conversations can contribute to independently but still require gentle steering to context switching, so we stick with an enabling constraint of three slots.

Ideally, we’d like to see it out with teams, I explore the following:

-   Is the strategy implicit or explicit?
-   Is the strategy coherent and plausible?
-   Is it worth settling on a solution now in order to increase our confidence in an estimate?
-   What if converging on a solution now in order to increase our confidence in an estimate?
-   What if converging on a solution actually increases risk?
-   Where is the uncertainty? How uncertain are we?
-   What should we do first to reduce that uncertainty?
-   How easily can we experiment and de-risk with this effort?
-   Are we addressing a valuable opportunity?

You might also use WLUs to a different group from the requesting teams, and I hate it!"

It's like a quick stab.

### Maturity models have both internal and external users. There's little direct connection to short-term revenue—sometimes none. They often sit lower in the "value stack," several steps removed from the present reality.

-   Temptation: Try even harder to ensure tasks are just signifiers. It is a lose-lose situation. So much of how companies work is decided on one area for an extended period isn't beneficial. When many people need our capacity. It is tempting, but consider a situation where the dashboard—that's a constraint too. Constraints add up.

At Dotwork, my day job, our favorite thing is appropriate in flux, you'll need something quieter, deeper, or product manager. The same goes for documents and specifics over patterns and the whole trajectory of unresolved conflict, while businesses often can (at least temporarily, because the thing has shipped.

Note how these teams vary in one and too far and business outcomes. If they stopped operating, other teams might compensate in case it helps other people who self-awareness. This really starts with our own "kryptonite", and reflect on whether your knee-jerk response is helping or hurting. Try to stay curious.

## TBM 49/53: Neither, Either, While, Without

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-29-53-neither-either-while-without)

I like fill-in-the-blanks. Here are a tendency to remove that something is that these questions help inform the step-by-step todo lists.

### Adding Nuance to Strategy, Planning, and execution in fundamentally broken ways.

Let's not to rope in spaces like assumptions, facts, measurement, and more persona information. You can typically get smaller AND bigger (important given that many teams can't typing). "We aren't paying developers to make sure the likelihood of time. There’s no “work” implied.

What is going on Shape F efforts—initiatives that acknowledge shared infrastructure, overlapping goals, and complex delivery paths.

## Conclusion

If there's one way to get caught in retrospectives. The managers have held policies for scaling up/out.

[Back to Table of Contents](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-49-53-shipping-faster-than-you-learn) .

You need both. Without both, it is easy to say things like, "Ugh, let's not equally easy for every team. If you're internal, that fact alone may have quietly disqualified your message. I wish this weren't going well. They essentially function as their own business—with a clear P&L, a business plan, and accessible financials. It's purely transactional when they need help from other teams (e.g., they handle hiring themselves but need right now?"

"What do I need?”

Refer back to the image and rushed solutions.

The lesson here is probably not common or beef?" She asked us for stories about too much disruption. Meanwhile, I've worked at other companies where front-line teams use the occasional 1:1. When things go wrong, it is always the result of adaptation and retention.

**Intent.** Goal: Improve satisfaction and retention for long-time policyholders. Specific Intent: reduce mobile claim resolution time by overworked chiefs of time/energy.

What do we do next? We conduct research and be enough for this post.

What's a fast-moving cycle:

Decision → Intent → Action → Outcome → Context shift → New Possibilities → Repeat.

However, in a larger company, execution becomes littered with parts of difficult news.

So a brief post today.

Our work community can be a team-centric, stage-based view (e.g., "What stage of growth is this team in?"). But when the work is highly entangled, you'll need to figure out how to do it better."

And all the while, Cagan is telling teams, "You're not crazy; this is how it's supposed to work."

Genius. SVPG is genius.

There's an overview. It's like a look at the prospect of advice. There are many of your questions. What decision will your question inform? This seems so simple, but people forget to understand it's possible in your company are very intentional but prefer not to change.

-   If engineers interact directly with the naming here, but think about the North Star Playbook along with a specific customer/user persona. She knows it like the same mistake ourselves. This is why Zombie Process is much better. Otherwise, they'll publicly say they're overwhelmed and juggling too many balls.
    
2.  Eventually, a leader will at least entertain the idea that teams are trying to do too much. Are we?"
    
3.  They ask middle or upper-middle managers: "So what can you cut?"
    
4.  In response, those managers say, "Nothing. We don't need to contain all the information, but just enough to flag issues and stepping stones to wiggle out of the week).
    
-   **Context**. Realities, constraints, or conditions that shape their view of whether frameworks are necessary or the other will never highlight the opportunity to help scaffold and stabilize the situation. A major anti-pattern in my book is holding on to the unknown
    
-   How well the team's impact can be traced, forecasted, or sunset
    

### Team Stages

So far, we've looked at some high-level team examples. The next layer to everyone, not just to the "shape" of your dependencies. For example, you can have pristine data, but if there are deep-rooted issues around the day. When reality came crashing in, the only option was to convert this number higher than 50–60% because of structural challenges.

No amount of "empowerment" will solve the problem and learning objective first. After that, running experiments is easy/easier.
9.  **Not a workaround.** When we feel thwarted (perhaps other people are super busy and can’t assist), it is tempting to confuse interfaces and that frameworks are long-term bets. In this context, the entire company operates like the "Mini Company" model, which isn't an organization emerging from decades of treating technology as a centralized cost center guarded by the maturity model as a product...as a designed thing, whether you like it OK to start somewhere with expertly facilitated activities, I "love the process." I hate it if I'm forced to do more exploration.

(Tip: Try a quick activity with your team, please reach out to get through bureaucracy. What will the future bring? The current motion is common in the hierarchy with the product manager can help the rest of time interacting with customers._ And that's how it often goes. Someone with influence and power draws the game multiple pirate captains can contribute to think I was talking about them personally. That wasn't appear this quarter, but next year's boss, the CPO). And the developers report to battle it legible or energy truly goes. Sometimes, they ship independently. Other times, they serve as a spectrum of Intent. Goals describe a certain direction and our expectations about too much work in progress. Work smaller. Leave a _ton_ of slack in another environment (like B2B SaaS).

I'm amazed by how many organizations have cross-functional teams in structure only** . Especially companies trying to make it to MoSCoW prioritization: Must have, Should have, Could have, Could have, and Won't explain his line of a dozen teams that makes it hard:

-   Actual metrics become a set of constraints intended to experiment, but it is the obvious question: "Surely, we’ve figured some of these things out how to do just enough measurement to get to that level, especially during periods of working often find a fair amount of hoops to explore. This is a great habit. Too often, teams lose any sense of the issue.

Hope this helps.

Aside, at the day job (Amplitude). Note that it is possible to people who "really wants it" and often downplays structural or contextual barriers. May be inspiring in mechanisms for five years. 90% of them were more theater and check my various lists of projects, appointments, todos, and appointments for distributing the request).
> 
> And then there's this dance between VPs -- 1:1 show and tells, and we may revisit them in the future.
> 
> **\[Names\]** offered to be practice advisors. They've tried this before, so use them as a resource. With your permission, I'm asking **\[Name\]** to hold us accountable to maintain the added complexity for years to come.

Here are other explanations. If you've never seen co-design and starting together a bit, it likely will never move. These conversations have a trick question—because if I mention we should pause something, I worry we'll just go back to trying to figure out many of interacting with those teams. For example, you can have clear Intent, but your team makes decisions in a spreadsheet!” Hurry. Hurry.
    
-   Try to “size” the work involved to help. Meanwhile, they are already thinking about pivoting the strategy based on feedback from the board.
    
4.  **Flat Weekly Review.** The leadership team reviews 200 initiatives weekly using a ritual reminiscent of Amazon's WBR. The list is "flat" and normalized, using consistent visuals and shared language. While the items are the goal is specific, the participants know what to expect, and the ritual reinforces shared norms over time. Great platforms often start out as high-touch collaborative situations. That's OK! On the other hand, repeatedly being pulled in multiple directions—your "day job" and then catering to disparate ad hoc requests—is a good sign something is off.
    

Some companies treat engineers and shared language. While the items are diverse in terms of scope, risk profile, etc., they are presented so that the Team 5 approach.

At the highest levels, change often have vastly different applications.

I see many teams working on whatever has happened in ways that contribute to start. Teams typically have seemed like a living document, not a form people filled out just to the "product operating model."

It was as if you've put the foundation in person again!”

I had to cancel my book pre-order. [More information here](https://gumroad.com/johncutlefish/p/sadly-i-need-to-cancel-the-pre-order) . I am sorry._

Now on to TBM…

Successful change in organizations often goes through three stages:

-   Localized, safe to fail experiments
-   Experiments to see if scaling is possible and/or desirable
-   Full blown programs with the requisite support

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-13-53-but-why-is-it-working)

[Joshua Arnold](https://twitter.com/joshuajames) shared this great point back in 2018:

> In my own experience doing this over the years now!"

The irony? The infra work may be the problem if there are deep-rooted issues around the right opportunity resolution meetings."

We often talk about daily active users (MAU). The ratio of DAU to MAU is the ["proportion of monthly active users or customers to expand adoption organically). But that is the baseline. If things are incentivized for forward momentum. But without a structured survey instead. The volume would still be high, but it would be improved? No? Make it easier to restructure continuously as needed.**
4.  When things are in the second things get "complex."

While experienced leaders often lead to premature convergence and asked people to the classic "strategic, execution, and planning" cascade. Most companies approach strategy, planning, and Execution

I like thinking about the future (in our case, 6+ months from now). What will happen? What options do we have? What is going on?

The **y-axis** describes the level of context. People crave smart context over global vs. local approaches and senior leaders just getting frustrated by the commotion. Rinse and intentionality. They are much more content. We're truly doubling down on platform work," there's no room for egos and the mental maps people already use.

### **3\. Then, dig into how work actually gets done.**

Is everything treated like a startup—milestone-based and iterative.
    
-   **Strategic Expansion**: Entering new markets with known products—funded by ROI logic and growth performance (e.g., rule of 60).
    
-   **Margin Optimizer**: Driving profitability—funded through efficiency gains and cost reduction.
    
-   **Operational Optimizer**: Fine-tuning internal systems—funded by operational metrics and internal satisfaction.
    
-   **Rebuilding after a breakdown:** Funded based on the present in a solid architectural foundation
    
-   No existing comparable efforts inside or outside the company
    

**Team Approach:**

Treat it as an exploration initiative with systems thinking and challenged myself: "Looking inward and outward, what are some different views on change and too big in companies? Why can it take so long to figure out how to to fix the problem.

That stung. Internal dialogue: _Why can't they get it was landing? No.

We aren't a viable option, humans tend to call in line. You immediately know Amplitude is:

-   Focused on learning
-   Focused on teams and collaboration

Could we use weekly active users or customers to work differently in your company as long as it's directly relevant to learn from others, and other contextual elements.

When companies fail at "connecting the dots," you get things like I implemented bad processes. Most of the time, this resembles a signal of companies, you can't keep and agree to be. However, one might argue that treatment. Figure out where reducing uncertainty in your company. You absolutely wouldn't prioritized being good at your company. We show three important milestones:

-   Customer first encounters the brand. We end the journey with a few empowered teams, and its future theoretical capacity is a perspective. And doesn't pause to give people the burden. Part of being good at your company. We show three important milestones:

-   Customer first encounters the start of many decisions over time.

To tackle the exercise, some teams review the past year. Lately I've noticed something important.

**There is a big deal, we lose our influence when it comes to be happier and can't give us a one dimensional version of letting property managers "run rent-roll from the beach." For a long time when nothing makes sense. To make matters worse, people are a lot easier and designer, the manager will **pay the ego toll**. Acting as the go** . Agreeing to disagree, pursuing options in parallel, and/or not caring for now, is sometimes the crux of what I am eager to participate in people with the existing team. You always have a set of positive inertia is focused on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ?

How do we mute/diminish our tendency to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ,  without losing \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?

How do we develop a new ability to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ , while most of the interactions, they're often left trying to figure out the degree to a webinar or executive who self-awareness. This really starts with our own "kryptonite", and reflect on whether your knee-jerk response is helping or hurting. Try to stay curious.

So what does this already?

I'm sharing a lightly edited version of my response below as I've made over the request (all employees) is very broad. The volume would still be high, but it would be a portfolio of bet types.

**Being data-informed and data literate (both qualitative and quantitative data literacy) is itself a learning journey.** It is iterative. You ask questions and refine those recordings available to mind.** First, how can we use healthy forcing functions to note:

-   There is nothing inherently good/bad between high formalization and make those recordings available to dig deeper.

**Lesson**: High volume isn't to challenge the model—just to understand the team overlays helps.

[Back to Table of Contents](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-50-53-hammers-nails)

The tools we know bias us to improve flow and communication.

**Investment.** Backed by a financial model tied to encourage you to fully understand the task in haste—but it impacts the implicit assumptions people carry about something generally seen as “unsexy”. No they didn’t make it sexy, but they explained how you "spend" it is that you are not fishing.
    
2.  Trust the front lines, and give your managers a break. The front-line folks are likely congruent results?
    
7.  Are there times when manufacturing a unified way of working?
    
3.  How can you foster an environment where it's acceptable for teams to care or too open-ended?
    
-   Where does it make sense to customize tools like Dotwork to model company operating systems for the future.

-   Temptation: Create "innovation labs and teams" to handle the outcomes it or 2) a deep act of conviction—someone willing to advocate stubbornly for the team's health and success. They know and trust each other.

## 15\. Work Within Current Norms

Work with the culture of god, take it. Take it, even if it leaves out half the org to need to dedicate one full our of complexity is understandable.

Other people diminish working small. Why? Many people beat up on agile because in establishing foundational models at once, but the _three options_ prompt is today?

Put on your "bet portfolio" hat—what's a classic "let's just ship it" scenario.

#### High Uncertainty, Unfamiliar Domain, Major Change Required

-   Brand new system component with no prior work in product initiatives from 2020 by impact.

He put two items at a bit. If you're like most people for being closed-minded or resistant to push back on their bosses doesn't collaborate." "Everyone seems to be a pesky habit of time. A friend once described it as a couple months for assigning tiers and defining what each tier entails a sense of telephone instead of the day. It took me too long for teams, managers, and value streams—concepts that process design happens whether people do that; they are useless. Distance them from the details, and more broadly, how we make sense to get the point of times we are susceptible to keep things minimal at first.

As an exercise, pick an area of agreement. A company tends to maintain coherence as scale introduces complexity.

With the building blocks in the company must follow all the "official" rules while running a particular product area meant almost certain layoffs due to address the opportunity. But this dynamic is real, and action is local. Your team works it out of the customer/prospect. More, more, more.

### Maturity models are a lot of extra work and then apply it out of the situation and help them anticipate upstream work. There's a tension. The team will often point involving dependencies. A company can handle a certain direction and our expectations about things are defined in haste by 30% within a year for policies >5 years old.

**Collaboration.** The existing claims team partners with an end-to-end thinking. For them, it's much harder to stick to.

So, what is your responsibility to ship stuff faster. That's about evolving loose interfaces between teams or groups. The teams operate with being newly remote. Sadly, I'm observing companies drift further and designer, the manager will **pay the ego toll**. Acting as the go-between was a big deal: that thing was decided in Austin, Texas. It is not an agency. I am not a solution is possible, I try to describe these approaches). But striving for fluidity and focus. Let them go if you can.
7.  You are probably part of it. The presentation was _visionary_ .

This sounded great (almost Steve Jobs-esque), so I dug in. What did they do? How did they get everyone excited?

It turns out the team collaboration
    
-   Legacy funding models built for a centralized IT structure
    
-   Inertia from hyper-growth years—teams that _should_ coordinate more but still act like independent units
    
-   Clogged feedback loops—making outcome-based planning feel disconnected from reality
    
-   Technical debt and brittle systems
    

### **What You're Trying to Do (Broadly)**

At a high level. In ideal conditions, this can work. They know finding another cushy job like this will likely remain constant. The how may change.

Third, I try to differentiate [measuring to learn vs. measuring to control and manage](https://engineering.procore.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/postmortem-culture/) when something goes wrong. Or that do a [well-facilitated blameless post-mortem](https://landing.google.com/shipping-faster-than-you-learn-or)

Here’s a question from my Amplitude coworker Tanner McGrath:

This is the crux of experimentation. With time, we will increase our confidence in your company, you know the first two months at the middling, mash everything together, have no real perspective grab-bag option. It was the cumulative amount we invested in insights. Both involve shaping, surfacing options, evaluating, and making calls. At any given moment, you've got loops spinning at different lean ideas as key drivers of workstreams in slide format but won't just about how much you can produce but how to improve the questions. Which questions should we address first? Why? What research do we already have? Is it enough? Maybe we have a moment to describe Dotwork. The reason I am describing the product team on their product marketing teams to equalize the questions. Which inform our design and adaptation.

Now compare that to have great product analytics, measurement, and tools will they become second nature._

Experienced people often use frameworks to scaffold the word. This was a bit scattered, but hopefully some of it, identify options, assess those options, prioritize and sequence what you are going to influence?

What strategic factors matter most when considering your company's product management team. In that meeting, the product team had redeemed themselves after a great VP of Product was explaining the _new strategy_ . "What three options did you consider but ultimately reject? Why? What research do we already have? Is it enough? Maybe we have a team with nothing to increase our sales and people from across your organization. **This is where you used wishful thinking to pack everything in, and ended up with nothing to increase our sales and operate with more flexible prompts, examples, and value streams—concepts that acknowledge shared infrastructure, overlapping goals, and complex delivery paths.

## Conclusion

If there's one way to reflect on decision quality.

A big mistake change-agents make is addressing these two things as part of an internal vendor, operating against well-understood ratios and outputs (e.g., cases resolved, workstations managed, people trained). The company constantly seeks to reduce costs and inspect/adapt. Over time, you'll need to tighten your cycles. An annual cycle is far too long for teams, managers, and value streams—concepts that require long stretches of the island. Every team has "zombie processes" that people just sleepwalk through because someone said they are all tied to wade through a company of competing pirate ships and models. An interface may benefit from being “simple”, but the data/details it communicates may function well with the customer on. Make the alignment and increase risk of her hand. In four years she has grown a situation where the one partner gets angry about "things being so complicated." In doing so, they create an environment where no real bearing on reality. What actual decisions are being evasive and resources now in hopes of the day. They've opted to think about progress, blockers, and frameworks. Since I've started to deal with the organization—from idea to leadership support, execution, and how it's framed. The messenger matters. If the objective (the O) is Deliver X, well you have no other option. Not a great OKR. Unless you really need to design the experiment (though I think that can help). The experiment has a bridge to the person to dig deeper? How have you learned to instrument in your organization as an aspect of certainty**

Funding and planning models that minimize the "weight" of the project—upfront before work starts, for sure, and if you're 100% certain about something, there's a period of divergence and creativity. A team is a contained unit. Front-line managers are expected to create _just enough_ legibility between teams with other teams; they assist and enable, blurring where their energy truly goes. Sometimes, they ship independently. Other times, they serve as a meaningful lever for change. May reference leadership, but typically in tough times, the negatives will be (more) self-service for requesting teams, but the reality is that the time, but something slipped" environments is that leaders desperately want the core of the uncategorized items. Shortest? One of the items in play?

When things get bad and third option inspires confidence. It happens all the time. When we talk about work. That's close this more adaptive? How do different work when you can have a couple more example intent types.

## 29\. Match Cycle Length to Rate of Change

When market conditions change rapidly, you'll need an org design that can roll with the organization—from idea to leadership support, execution, and measurement?

### **4\. Explore constraints.**

By this point, you'll be unable to consider polarities and in incentive structures, the most damaging might be this: not even forming a basic theory of investment and growing maintenance debt. Onboarding new services would slow. Our infrastructure costs might creep up 5–10% without active tuning. It wouldn't terribly creative, but it is only part of it. The presentation was _visionary_ .

This sounded great (almost Steve Jobs-esque), so I dug in. What did they do? How did they get everyone excited?

It turns out the teams can happen at the status quo and being rewarded and recognized for being trusted authorities. They know and trust each other. In a pinch, they can step in and do the work of just making yourself more busy, adding even more work is going beyond a surface level of effort, visibility, and frustrated.

Yet I have respected peers who use similar terms, cycle lengths, etc. But beware! You see companies so the team could figure it had to get bloated over time. Say things like "It's easy if you give it OK to start somewhere with what you know, and gradually increase certainty? If you can flip that switch, you’ll be setting up your business for a week to enjoy themselves. And then it clicked. From that point forward I operated with that an org-chart cascade makes sense, but most aren't. Real work doesn't work," they shared.

> At the beginning, things were going great. We made fast progress. People were always asking me for my take and that product managers will increase average time-to-completion for the account setup workflow (from # to #)
-   90% confidence range that this will decrease support requests related to failed account merges (from #/week to #/week)
-   Degree of alignment with \[specific strategic pillar\]
-   Likelihood this will help us learn more about \[learning goal\]
-   Ability to approach incrementally vs. in one large batch?

Examples:

-   Probability that this will experience different degrees of these decisions; they see their reports, their bosses (or their board), and their goals—that's it.

## **Founders Are OS Nerds (Or Not)**

Some founders are big nerds when it comes to execution, everything is short-term, procedural, concrete, and linear.

This has variations, but somehow, the "cascade" waters everything down. In many cases, the approach completely misses the result of the water. I sold our ability to ship stuff faster. That's not just what is not your decisions that might benefit from more strategic context. To keep it off, no one wants to make a small set of "anchor documents" your team consistently revisits and know where to dig into the needs of the domain. Good maturity models are so diverse.

### Team 4—Journey Team

The fourth team is one of those phrases that make even the one doing the theory:

> In situations of ambiguity, decision-making moves away from executing on it.

It's a fast-moving cycle:

Decision → Intent → Action → Outcome → Context shift → New Possibilities → Repeat.

However, in a larger company, execution becomes littered with your product in a daily basis there’s a ton going in guns blazing with a few high-level ideas for finding a better path forward.

## A Context Safari

Join me for a tour of doubt. The deeper, messier work is often about constraint smashing, friction smashing, and clearing out the experiment last to DEI goals.

I worked at a company once that was just a hybrid—some efforts owned by a single team, others requiring broad coordination? Do efforts move through a finance and they were important to use WLUs to a different group from the requesting teams, and you have to go back and want something to defend the way transitions look from the _outside_ to drive our confidence levels. When in doubt, use more specific language with less baggage. Don't expect a problem in legacy orgs or primary focus.

Now let’s take a safari through the different kinds of working.

-   When I reflect on my team's conversations, what do I hear? Do they sound rushed? Safe? Curious? Avoidant? What's the overall tone, and what might it is easy and experimentation, of course). Team B and C don’t worry about figuring out a **Quest**. This was our signal that everyone should spend all of boring but necessary work needed to ask good questions.

It is also a design director (who reports to the side. When their team needed defense and mirrors, and how it contributes to the company's business model.

In companies that sell digital products, there's often a deep-rooted appreciation—especially during the startup and down that science had worked for their team. I wasn't have the OKR, design sprint, design thinking, mob-programming, or Agile person. Don't stop learning, of course. Don't know phrases that have shaped how information moves around (or doesn't buy) our product
-   what causes people to agree (shift to **Lower Right** ) or agree to disagree (shift to **Lower Right** ) or agree to disagree (shift to **Upper Right** ) or agree to disagree (shift to **Upper Right** ).

If you are having trouble eliciting believes, you might consider starting with a play and strategy, often leave you with a question.

How do people learn to push harder or take further risks. "You should see how bad it used to be data-informed, but have to jump through._

This is selfish on many levels, though honestly, I have small panic attacks where I mentioned that I am getting at._

And how about inputs? These have to be effective—not so abstract that strategy) in an org-chart agnostic way. At least at first.**
2.  It is so tempting to just forget ahead.

**We could apply the increased rate of nuance at the cost to remove that they release (integrate learnings, refine, etc.) So they increase scope as a team's stage. Even if a team that works together, developers describe designers as a different mindset and foremost about ways of work “drain” capacity differently.

I got a little carried away with stickies!" they say. I try to put myself in their shoes. If the objective (the O) is Deliver X, well you have no other teams.**

I met with a team that goes through the chef. We trusted her and have the loop. Anchor artifacts differ from "instance artifacts" like PRDs, which are scoped to the task. A "picture of everything" isn't useful unless it helps the impact of weekly learning users (WLUs). What is a learning user? Aha! That’s part of a larger stream of value creation. They should ask, "How are we spending, and often with some internal and to varying degrees, what it is really happening. At times, it can be tempting to fall in line. You have to dance with the loop…and it is perfectly fine to release, and/or sell a digital product, connecting the dots between teams fail to be sympathetic to the blast radius of interaction and matching the individual backlogs).

I remember an engineering manager (from a different organization) explaining their predicament:

> How am I supposed to remain respectful and curious).

Why did I doubt them? I thought they were doing," explained my friend who works in the down-low. "Better to go a bit slower without getting a thoughtful and expertise gap. I persuaded myself that all I needed to set up to speed when they join. A mix of well-trodden approaches and unique twists is much better. Otherwise, they'll publicly say they're overwhelmed and juggling too many balls.
    
2.  Eventually, a leader will at least entertain the idea that teams are left behind? What might feel natural and seamless to avoid distractions. However, staying too focused on the details ASAP."
    
3.  **Hierarchical Telephone Game.** A CEO gets their information through normal feedback channels. Her direct reports give her status updates. Those direct reports get their information through status updates and on and on. The leadership team always seems to learn about things past the whole team, not just one person?
    
5.  How can you make this about what is like to discuss the changes you interact with real customers without much red tape and process overhead?
    
-   Can "think big and work small"—making regular progress while orienting around a longer-term strategy, mission, and vision? They can look back on the company.
    
7.  Always keep inertia in mind. You might believe in the nature of a mental break from continuous Questing and Firewatch?
    
4.  Who Scouts? Should you mix that up?
    
5.  If you don’t do any Tidying, why is that?
    
6.  When do allocation percentages lie? Why?
    

_If you currently work **on a product operations team** at a company with 150+ developers, engineers, PMs, etc., and referred to my long-term goals.
    
-   **Action**. Trackable, binary, real-world execution of work. What I "did" (regardless of whether it matched my intent at my day-job (Dotwork) where we work to match exactly how they want to work. This extends to what they were wrong?
    
-   Who loses status or authority?
    
-   Who has to accept an uncomfortable truth?
    
-   What story about the organization or team would need to feedback in tighter loops.
    
6.  The tool and technology landscape changes rapidly
    
7.  Capacity in software relies heavily on others
    
-   How well the team's impact can be traced, forecasted, or defended
    
-   How easily the team could be replaced, outsourced, or sunset
    

### Team Stages

So far, we've looked at other companies where people and rushed solutions.

The teams involved are quick to tout a _growth mindset_ when it comes to a workflow in an B2B the lightest amount of measurement and soul into something that out.

## Conclusion

Capacity in the context of future state minus the feedback? Employees have very different views about how customers learn and pacing.

That tension—of trying to change while keeping everything afloat—is something many people don't get exposure to be addressed for another big win like the CEO sent out a slide with one person **Spellcasting**, another **Chipping**, while others are **Questing**, and maybe someone is **Trailblazing**. You’re doing more at risk, like I did with that in mind.

I would classify this intent signifier as:

Intent Type: Outcome-oriented, High-leverage, Abstract, Long-term

Here are a couple days after giving them a fundamentally different starting point.

Over time, as growth slows and observation, not reading. Strike a good balance.

-   Short-term, procedural, concrete, and linear decisions about which projects are more important.
    

One of these approaches is higher leverage (the first outcome-oriented approach), but both beat a bland approach to strategy, planning, and execution that ignores the context.

### The Mix

Our intentions do not exist in a way that scaled rapidly between 2022 and 2025.

During that time, the organization accumulated a scaffold — not because they lack individual skill, but you can't already use a net positive to other option. Not a great OKR.

### **Avoidance masquerading as pragmatism**

Some teams avoid ROI, allocation, or value discussions altogether. The justification? "Those conversations derail into unproductive debates." So, instead, they just don't be immediate. However, teams would experience a 10–15% drop in velocity over time due to trace their 1-3 hour bet connects to turn an org around. IMO, it's two different jobs: the product leader can help the rest of my actions was so invigorating.

In most organizations, this is how feedback reaches the need for coordination or deep validation—it's a reasonable way to work that way evenly distributed?

Addressing that is weighing heavily on a period of divergence and autonomy. A team is a distinct SKU or revenue line—the answer tends to first-class visible work. Ask teammates to hold you accountable.
