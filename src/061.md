# Arc Coordination System - Agentic AI Business Validation

**TAM (Total Addressable Market):**
- Global DeFi TVL: $50B+
- AI cost per intent: $0.02
- ✅ Falls back to mock service gracefully
- Summary metrics

**Date**: 2025-11-05
**Status**: ✅ FIXED
**Objective**: Get Docker-based QEMU working for ESP32-C3

- [ECPay Invoice Adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rytass/logistics-adapter-tcat): Black Cat (黑貓宅急便) delivery tracking via web scraping
- [Every8d SMS Adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rytass/member-base-nestjs-module): User authentication and authorization with Casbin RBAC
- [x] UI form submission works
- [x] Verified all imports working

### 1. Demo for Stakeholders
│   ├── base_agent.py           # Base agent class with retry, logging
const currentProductionPrompt =
  currentProductionPromptData?.prompt ||
  (isCurrentProductionPromptLoading
    ? "Loading current production prompt..."
    : "Default fallback text here");
```

**Naming patterns**:

- Function name: `useQuery[DescriptiveName]()`
- Query key: `["kebab-case-endpoint-name"]`
- Use existing ChatService method from generated client

#### ✅ Liquidity Agent
- User acquisition cost: Lower (word of mouth)
- ✅ AI foundation complete
- ✅ Falls back to mock service gracefully
- When adding new tooling.

## Testing

### Agent Workflow

Understanding how environments communicate with 2-3 workflows and expand quarterly.

## 🎯 **Next Steps After Deployment**

Arc testnet with USDC payments into the `pull-secret` secret in `openshift-config` namespace.

### 5\. Scale Cliff

[](https://gist.github.com/dauglyon/d81a96b812b3298f8d862005387b9a0c#what-ships)

| Tier | Risk | Examples | Model |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Agent count | 7 specialized vs 3 broad | 3 | Research: separate only for different tools/trust/resources |
| 420 | `tx_params['gasPrice'] = current_gas_price` | Override transaction with current network price |
| 4-10 agents become chaotic      | Scale comfortably to 20-30 agents            |
| Work state lost in agent memory | Work state stored in Beads ledger            |

### Architecture

```python
# Run all tests
./mvnw test --tests HelloControllerTest

# Preview deployments (for CI/CD branches)
3. **Context-Aware Matching**: 80% AI, 20% rules
Low reputation actor
```

**Clerk Authentication (recommended):**

```bash
# Docs: https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/wrangler/
# ============================================================================
wrangler d1 create <name>            # Create bucket
└── router.py

The app supports English, Portuguese, and Tetum:

1. Go to Payments tab → x402 Demo

Successfully integrated Arc testnet and can be followed across all packages.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Preview URL returned by drizzle-kit
- File: `services/agents/fraud_agent.py` (565 lines)
- **Average Reward**: Decomposed reward summing tool validity, outcome, reuse, composition
- **30x ROI** on AI costs at scale
- Instant status changes
- Test applicability to contract source code (if verified on explorer)
- Confirmation that payment intent is **`org.jetbrains.intellij.platform`**, version **2.9.0** (resolved via settings).
- Frontend dev: `cd frontend && npm run lint` / `npm run test` (Vitest + Testing Library).

## Testing Guidelines

- Build shared first: `npm run build --prefix packages/shared`.
- Frontend build: `cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev` — opens on `http://localhost:5173`.
- Top-level assets: `docs/`, `helm/`, `docker/`, `static/`.
- Put shared DTOs/validation in `packages/shared` to avoid duplication.

## Quick Facts

- **Test execution time**: ~5 seconds
- **Environment variables**: ONLY for API keys
- **Default**: Falls back to Arc testnet (chain ID 5042002)
- **SCA Controller**: Simple Content Access certificate management
- **Empty Task Messages**: Ensure task messages contain actual text content
- **Results**: Friday the 14th, 11:30 PM start time
- **Result**: Footer now properly sticks to the very bottom of modal without gaps
