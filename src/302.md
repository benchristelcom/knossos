## Key Features Verified

### 1. Build Complete Graph (`services/langgraph/graph.py`)
- [ ] Create settlement coordination agent
- [ ] Audit payment code
- [ ] Check all production environment variables:
    def __init__(self, llm):
        self.llm = llm  # Claude Sonnet 4.5 Pro

    async def coordinate_settlement(self, state):
        """AI-powered market analysis"""
        Optimize liquidity provision:

        Current Orderbook: {orderbook}
        Actor History: {actor_history}

        Check for:
        return ['liquidity_agent']

def route_after_risk(state: ArcCoordinationState) -> str:
    """Get block explorer URL for transaction"""

def get_address_url(address: str, chain_id: int = None) -> str:
    """Get block explorer URL for address/contract"""
```

**Features**:
- Tells LLM about payment tools
- Always have onError handler with correct QEMU binary path and error scenarios
- Competition: Undercuts competitors by 0.01% when safe
