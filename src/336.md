# x402 Payment Demo - Arc Testnet Integration Fixed

**ui/x402_payment_demo.py:442-458**:
```python
const runtime = detectRuntime();
const buffer = audioFile.getFileBuffer();
audioFile.dispose();

// Read tags from an audio file (accepts path, buffer, or File)
npm install drizzle-orm
✅ **State Management**: State updates and explanations
4. **Validate After Conversion**: Read back the converted file to verify metadata
Settlement Asset: USD, USDT, etc.
If I say "the process is x" in some way.
On the other hand, you MUST ask for clarification before running on full dataset

### Build & Development
- **Log Stack**: Loki (configurable), Promtail, Syslog-ng
- **Test (all)**: `pnpm test` or `turbo test`
- **Payment Demo Guide**: `PAYMENT_DEMO_GUIDE.md`
- **Route protection**: `adminHasPermission:Permission Name` middleware  
- **DataTable protection**: Each DataTable has `permissions()` method
- **Writing Approach**: 
  - Focus on facts
  - Create schedule data model and storage strategy
  - Ready for graph implementation
- [x] Scales linearly with volume
- [x] Charts render with populated data
- [Bank Pro Invoice Adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rytass/secret-adapter-vault-nestjs): HashiCorp Vault client for secrets management

## AutoDataTable Component Usage

### Low-Value Use Cases (Don't use AI for these)

The system depends on scientists voluntarily reviewing proposals. No clear incentive structure designed — unlike tenant access requests (someone is blocked waiting), stewardship proposals have no inherent urgency. This is not been human reviewed so may have errors or bugs!

### Local Setup (5 Minutes)

```bash
# Arc Testnet
