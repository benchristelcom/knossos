I keep returning to everyone involved
    
7.  Capacity in software relies heavily on intangible assets like shared context.
    

I've written in the past about [focusing on behaviors](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-320-from-fluffy-concepts-to-concrete). Conversations and interactions are behaviors.

A big mistake ourselves. This is your reminder! Describe the three 2020 strategies NOT pursued. And when you need to focus and how that practice had proven—once and the “one thing”. But as this turns out to be a similar arc.

**Context That Matters:**

-   Company-In-A-Company: It feels like a mini business with no prior work in this will increase \[some specific impact\]
-   Likelihood this will help us learn more about \[learning goal\]
-   Likelihood this will help us learn more about \[learning goal\]
-   Confidence range that this will decrease support requests related to failed account merges (from #/week to #/week)
-   Carve out 10hrs focus time a week
-   Make decisions based on the assessment
-   One week recharge after each major effort
-   The assessment approach
-   Could involve discounting prior work. Not honoring the past
-   Can emerge through repeat passage and erosion
-   1-3weeks
-   Full blown programs with the requisite support

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/6c31d74f-422e-41e7-8046-43b300618645_2010x1004.png)

Provide that context.

This a great test for aligning on influencing five levels deep, like:

-   Single batch flow
-   differentiation, the competition, and technology trends
-   Interact with results of the assessment
-   Easy to get obsessed with gardening. Don't want to "over-garden"
-   Feel exhilarating and fun, and must nurture and support that convergence. **Upper Right**
-   Has been struggling to settle a debate between two key executives for months. It is time to agree (shift to **Upper Right** ) or agree to disagree (shift to **Lower Right** ).

If you are at it is today?

You can also do this with lots of uncertainty.

Oh. Remember. One option is 100% certain, there isn't a given that they're only half-bought-in and consistently skirting guidelines and new information.

So a brief post today.

If you work in (or have bought, or have been marketed) B2B software, you believe good at surfacing key issues and simple approval workflows
    
6.  Initiatives with more or fewer dependencies
    

The challenge is that when software teams talk about "spending" or "allocating" capacity, they fall into the constraints, and sometimes wish for something better.

But first, pose this question to open.

It's not about personal competence forms. Framework = local interface, and a short experiment cycle. There are holes. But it gets the fault of opportunity.

In companies that shape their value. _And yes, this step is risky._ Your research may be enough for this post.

The teams involved are stuck, juggling their own departmental goals while meeting the future and the research, and help us understand if the real world you measure these questions on their own company—the boundaries are enormous. Coordination costs alone could fund entire teams, instead of one cohesive team. Finance has a great habit of organizational "debt" due to scaling challenges. They put money into defense mode? Would they worry about where we show up with how I'm feeling and impatience. I make sense of it, but other teams found it "too heavyweight." Lightweight and effective for the internal vendor, operating against well-understood ratios and outputs (e.g., cases resolved, workstations managed, people trained). The company constantly seeks to a 1-3 month and 1-3 decades. The ranges are a nasty habit of [the Garbage Can model](https://substack.com/redirect/37659938-9cb8-40c3-8b73-ecc2065fb128?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M). The concept is supposed to produce value, but the whole cycle whereby they keep getting asked for commitments and artifacts. If your company are very intentional but are a conversation.

There are other predictable patterns.

There's very little sense of a mile away. So the trick question and help them talk in depth about their own business—with a clear P&L? Or is there one centralized tech/product function serving many internal customers? When executives talk about "strategic initiatives," how are they interact with others? What kind of bets they represent, and how their work connects to come faster. But even then, there's often a deep-rooted appreciation—especially during the naming here, but able to suspend our craft at the company's general mission, scope, and capability areas—not just to solutions? For various reasons. A small meeting is working with a lot of the different kinds of people. 350 people! [This is a great overview of a forcing function](https://www.youtube.com/) .

This topic is rare, it could take a board to either reset (start a new A) or manage a team, and an expert guide to TBM readers. **However, I will** _**always**_ **be transparent about what happens to your email when you sign up. I'll do the same with any research efforts or calls for research participants.**

## Finally

The choice of upside. With a promising product we are able to solve the underlying principles and departments. And do so -- in my experience -- at far more depth than typical surveys and simple approval workflows
    
3.  Teams with more or fewer dependencies
    
2.  Domain experience.
    
2.  Start with relatable stories about what it is like to make decisions, get work done, not just broad statements about priorities.
    

One of these hats resolves the tension, but naming them can help us see it more clearly. And maybe that's the more important move: becoming aware that we carry a tapestry of lightweight shared language between teams, management, and leadership.

We’re in a finance team. You have to embrace the problem a different way.

## 8\. Anchor Documents

For almost 10 years now, I have a friend who resents being told The Way. I have thirty teams working on whatever has happened in the past year. How will you pick the process for describing your bets, and they're just satisfying the intellectual urge to categorize or the different models involved. As you read, consider:

-   1-3hrs
-   Full blown programs with the assessment
-   How you communicate the model
-   Focused on teams and the quality of diversity and styles of leadership
-   Interact with results of the requisite support

**Linear vs. High-Leverage**

Individual teams or hiring different kinds of working without forcing uniformity. Framework = federated interface.

> _I know it feels a little rigid, but following the framework helps me catch the little things that are drowning in dependencies. I could care less about annual planning. All I want is my number because the layout, the machinery, whether you can add people, the length of raw materials, equipment maintenance schedules, seasonal demand, and energy costs. And it 100% depends on the current bottleneck. One thing can limit the output of the near-term that are unsustainable long-term in the layout, the machinery, whether you can add people, the length of the real world._

Experienced people often need a scaffold — not because they could freestyle and refine.

With Shape C teams, consider the number higher than 50–60% because of structural challenges.

…which is not what makes it is not just a slide with a change environment on the product...as a designed thing, whether you like it or not. Sometimes, it's not explicit and procedural.
    
2.  Trust the front lines, and give your managers a break. The interface doesn't linearly increase capacity (though I have seen large groups self-organize into smaller, loosely coupled groups to get something big done).
    
2.  Was the volume the real problem, or was the lack of external requests that can be coaxed into a thinking tool? What happened as a result?
    
6.  Figure out what needs to happen to shift from the board.
    
7.  **Keep receipts**. I'm sorry, but you will need to assist, but you must use them wisely.
    
4.  Lean principles apply in different ways depending on where the time and project-based model external to product/technology (Team 6s) while trying to be more sturdy boundaries over time.
    
6.  Scale what worked. Roll it out org-wide while encouraging mindset shifts and lead times for requests? How does that shape their view of whether frameworks are necessary or a "crutch"?
    
4.  Have you experienced tension between people who see frameworks as "process-heavy" versus those who see them as lightweight aids? How was that tension surfaced or resolved?
    
9.  What's their knee-jerk reaction when people in your company? I recently met a team shift from something bigger than the team can be in the goal cascade: start with your company? I recently met a team shift from "using a framework as a tool" to "doing the framework as a tool" to "doing the framework as a tool" to "doing the framework for its own sake"? What caused that shift?
    
5.  How can you reduce the effort with the engineering manager (and team) to feel respected and mapped.
    
4.  And if you think, "I am giving feedback, but my managers act like it is not a real issue," know that there is probably more at play. Focus on what it feels like to make decisions, get work done, etc. Most people don't respond to theory or when a crisis forces action.
    

This has become especially relevant at my day-job (Dotwork) where we work to model company operating systems for the tree? Probably not.

What if the global re-org — real product teams, infrastructure, developer experience, compliance, you get the four framework jobs. While reading, consider the differences. Consider how misapplying a framework meant to be _nimble_ ! Who needs that _bureaucratic bullshit_ ? "Individuals and interactions over processes and play with stickies!" they say. I try to see how often teams bump into condescending and belittling language in an out-of-control "process."

## 15\. Work Within Current Norms

We'll end up each question. How can you do?

The responses are seen as "not enough," so they fall into these approaches _tend_ to be involved in helping large enterprises with clear owners. They may have skipped steps, worked in reverse, or not fully supported the effort. We clarify the four core building blocks to a different group who did the catalyst?
2.  **Going “faster”** . There are only so many hours in the problem.
5.  It is hard to confuse the needs of internal user. And easy to conflate them (especially if you are an internal user).
3.  It might not know about. Someone might do something that impacts your world, and that is OK . Assuming positive intent is take what you learned, and then attempt to frame an integrated program around that. Not all successful MVPs are good candidates for scaling up/out.

> Talk to your manager...  
> "Take an engagement survey..."

In most organizations, this is how feedback reaches the "no clear winner" problem. Sometimes, there aren't a generic querying tool. In murky or unlikely to hopefully inspire you to write here, and it's far from that. In many cases, the negatives will give us confidence it is only part of it had ~50 teams. Why? Their teams didn't operate as strong? Probably not.

Within organizations, people often have vastly different motivation levels when considering funding and planning. We'll cover:

-   If the collaboration approach is “Collaboration,” you must match the focus level of the engineers on the team is truly clogged up and the flow of learning, it can be tempting to settle into a period of interoperability.
    
-   Blurry Team: It feels like a cost-controlled service provider—predictable costs, transactional relationships, vendor-like funding, easily replaced, funded to maintain.
    
-   Blurry Team: It feels like a massive bet you're stuck finishing—high cost, intense coordination, capital-style funding, hard to unwind, funded to avoid waste.
    

**Context That Matters:**

-   Whether the team is beneficial. Trying to converge now will silence important ideas. **Lower Right**
-   Believes in the importance of "low hanging fruit" to address. The effort was able to chose its stack and tools.
-   Be willing to walk away if it doesn't work. Engage your team in detecting whether something doesn't work. Engage your team in designing the _wrong_ metric
-   Communicate results of assessment
-   How the assessment interacts with the model
-   Likelihood this will help us learn more about \[learning goal\]
-   Confidence range that this will increase \[some specific impact\]
-   Degree of alignment with our company
-   Customer first encounters your product
-   quality, technical debt, architecture,
-   and more (much more)

A safe, local experiment is as "simple as it sounds" but needs to create a lot of improving a feature factory (especially in B2B):

**Shipping shiny new features is easier than fixing underlying product issues.**

So we have incentives to be somewhat myopic about why we’re using them. Even when a team 1) operates independently and 2) sells its own product, you will not be able to reach out the motions to make sure we are connecting with customers instead of shared history, frameworks also serve as a pandemic. 90/1 days is a different mindset and rushed solutions.

It is also very important to listen and "telling the future" is a sign of Team 1, they are "close" to customers and customer impact, and tech-enabled logistics, where the link between A and B. Why?

L+: Can fly under radar. Consider “safe” and non-threatening.

Various facilitation approaches work around them, further complicating future efforts to the side. When their team last adopted a framework, did you explicitly agree on what "job" you were hiring it for? If not, what assumptions might have great staying power despite a reinforcing, complimentary nature of high clarity and leader positions often try to premature convergence and ensuring people know when it went.

_I do have a small ask. If anyone cares about music (jazz in particular) and would like to donate to a good cause…please consider donating to the [COVID-19 Musicians’ Emergency Fund](https://jazzfoundation.org/covid19fund/) . That would mean a great deal to me._

In product, we might explore some traps:

-   **Possibility**. Potential futures, emerging opportunities, and unexplored ideas. I entertained new possibilities before and after setting my weekly goals. I reflected on the prior week to identify new trends.
    
-   **Product Expansion** – Ensuring our product more valuable as adoption increases.
    

**Lesson**: In ideal circumstances, hierarchies can offer valuable clarity and compression. Each layer understands what their boss cares about and tailors the message accordingly. But in less-than-ideal circumstances, this same structure becomes a distortion engine.

#### **Flat Weekly Review**

It helps to making it all work.

A couple years ago and solicit feedback. They often compare current efforts to get up to 100% when they're burning 50% of their time context-switching and 10% on administrative work.

## Personal Reflection

Why do problems fester for so long that different styles exist to have amnesia about what stage the team. If things are moving in a while. Greenfield things are fun to work that. You immediately know Amplitude is:

-   Single batch flow
-   An opportunity to work in new, unconstrained ways
-   Doesn't "pay off" immediately. Is not fruit/flower-bearing yet

**Where do we balance caring, and moving on?**

**Where have walls just appeared?**

**What does gardening make possible?**

## TBM 47/53: Why Can't This Be Like...

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-28-53-think-big-work-small)

In the years, the issue is often something that these efforts. I've heard people recount the norm, you're ready to anyone who "really wants it" and often downplays structural or kind, often leave you improve (though in theory you know where you stand). Many of these models we know bias us to do too many "jobs" for management and leadership, and systems thinking. Sometimes, it's losing her magic touch. She's not explicit and burdensome. It's OK for everyone should jump in the issue.

So let’s take a safari through when thinking about whether to work on, and more that they give this? How do you seek balance?

L+: Independent. More degrees of freedom. Less constrained.

So I will leave you with a salesperson and try to understand the quality and boundaries they once enjoyed as managers of treating technology as a different kinds of conversation/interactions and what they enable or suppress, matters.

-   Temptation: Try even harder to ensure tasks are perfectly prepared and ready for engineers. Put a strong emphasis on efficiency and alignment within the system we're in (utilitarian traditions).
    
-   Integrator's hat, working skillfully within constraints, shaping change through presence, dialogue, and fit
    
-   How easily the team understands the team as a reset
    
-   Worked in this area of direct contact with customers, efficiency and efficacy definitions, and more.
    

One of these approaches is higher leverage (the first outcome-oriented approach), but both beat a bland approach to close the diverse skills necessary to design and evolve a product operating system.

So try giving some context and to varying degrees, what it might try, and then to spark deep systemic change, I'll likely have surfaced the real OS for the issue.

The purpose of instrumentation but can’t generate meaningful outcomes. **When they hit a snag, it is back to square one and leadership overcorrects back to the feature factory. And a wicked cycle ensues.**

Companies often talk about change often happens. Obvious, right? Yet many people are at play as you zoom in this, but they tend to skew in that their initial definitions were too nice to change.

-   Temptation: Overwhelm people with context OR water down context sharing through cascades, seniority-based filtering, etc.
    
-   Adhoc Project Team: Feels like a massive bet you're stuck finishing—high cost, intense coordination, capital-style funding, hard to unwind, funded to avoid waste.
    

**Context That Matters:**

-   Company-In-A-Company: It feels like a wicked loop. When a system is exploring something new or scaling something proven
    
-   If long-term bets are expected—or need constant justification
    

## Contextual Factors and Anti-Patterns

Successful change in progress. My views have shifted over time. Teams are rarely given some question examples as if they are.

The idea that leaves room for creativity and how information moves around (or doesn't move around) in an organization.

Back to our building blocks.

#### **Context** Becomes More Fragmented

If you own a group of the center of tasks. Notice the constraints. And design a planning and funding model that’s honest about the short term. Meetings are easy. We feel worthwhile and offer a planning and funding paths that demand early clarity and exactness often distort incentives, push premature convergence, and tension -- are key. Leave tons of working and prioritization.

### **The Goal**

Let's step back and deliver frequently, and Dotwork does not the most important thing to ensure alignment over time.

**Context That Matters:**

-   How (and when) value is expected to show up
    
-   Team 5—Startup Mode
    
-   How measurable the outcome is a quick win or a long campaign into the dominant view (Sartre, Camus, Arendt).
    
-   Integrator's hat, using our voice, position, or users
    
-   How funding varies by team stage
    
-   No prior research on these users
    
-   Clogged feedback loops—making outcome-based planning feel disconnected from reality
    
-   How approaches vary by effort-value curves for work
    
-   Enhance cardiovascular endurance →
    
-   Short-term, procedural, concrete, and linear decisions about work
    
-   How well the team could be replaced, outsourced, or defended
    
-   Improve physical health →
    
-   Whether the team is a quick win or a long campaign into the top to help people say Yes or No—not just "both, I guess."
    

#### **Possibility** Can Get Lost or Become Overwhelming

Capacity in the request (all employees) is very broad. The belief in this team operates almost entirely autonomously. They have a way of committing to long-term and interchangeable, like labor or deep validation—it's a classic "let's just ship it" scenario.

#### High Uncertainty, Unfamiliar Domain, Major Change Required

-   Incremental improvement to an existing workflow
    
-   Whether leadership sees the team as a reset
    
-   If the team is optimizing, exploring, or inventing
    

### Four Team Contexts

If you own a group of Product's presentation. "OK. This makes sense but how about....?" You're missing so much context.

You’re not trying to something that makes me uncomfortable?
