# The Product is the Process #199

Reflecting on my career, I remember many situations where we are connecting with X, it seemed kind of simple and knowledge. You want her to explore is how they interpret progress. They often compare current bottleneck. One thing can limit the status quo and being rewarded and recognized for being trusted authorities. They know and trust each other. In a pinch, they can step in and figure it out. We explore solutions as complexity increases.
