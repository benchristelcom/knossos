The updates to verify current APIs:

**Core Infrastructure:**
- `logging_feature_flag: false` - Alternative log processor

**Available Folders:**
- `src/lerobot/robots/so100_follower/so101_follower.py`

**Fix:** For demo purposes, create an in-memory database or use correct nonce:

```bash
rg "pattern" -g "*.md"          # Only Markdown
const result = await TagLib.initialize();

// Create variable with fallback
async def test_agent_under_high_volatility():
    """Test description."""
    # Arrange
    onProgress: (processed, total, file) => {
      // Write progress to stderr so it doesn't interfere with output
      llm: *llm
    - task: agent
```

## Development Guidelines

### Core Components

#### Liquidity Agent (`services/agents/liquidity_agent.py`)
- Worktree directories are built before Docker build

### 2. **Agent Cards**

1. **Natural Language Intents**: Users can describe trades in plain English
description = "Standard release process"
description = "Run make build"
2. Fill out form:
   - Requires Wasmtime CLI installed
   - Share LLM config between query and chat

### Cost
- [x] Each phase delivers value
- [x] Streamlit UI loads without errors
- [Custom Build Script](https://github.com/rytass/rytass-utils/blob/main/CLAUDE.md): Development guide and build caching
- [x] Success message displays in UI
- [x] Verified state management working

### 🔒 Production Checklist

- [ ] Use dedicated payment wallet with limited funds
- [ ] Record lessons (if any)

### Week 3-4
4. Document scope changes in `src/test/java`
2. **Use dedicated wallet** - Create new wallet with clear separation of task.
