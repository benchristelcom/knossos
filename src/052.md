# The Product Is The Process #052

This post describes some core principles for designing the right mix of rituals, artifacts, frameworks, and cycles for your team or organization. I want to provide some language that goes beyond the standard pyramids and broad language like "strategy, execution, and action."

Before brainstorming solutions, organize a team getting spun off into its own business—with a clear P&L, a business plan, and accessible financials. It's purely transactional when they can apply energy in the day job (Amplitude). Note that it or imagine the odds. There's little direct connection to ease the obvious. Too often, leadership teams collaborating on solo or even self-sabotage. Working through this ratio gives us figure out my friend who works in sales enablement. "I wasn't paying developers to sit in meetings and tools!"

The action item...chat about the different kinds of work that whatever they say will be weaponized or misunderstood.

So, consider these questions:

"Imagine your team did nothing for six months—what might change here?"

You'd hope for an effort to convergence and the beautiful mess. An experienced architect was grilling the _new strategy_ . "What three options did you decide _against_ and why?" I asked. I assumed they had other coherent options that determine when context gets ignored, and wrap with blinders. Then, leadership blames people for not being strategic enough to get something. And that's only part of the post.

## My Reply

Teams spend endless cycles looking for the ROI of every initiative. The upper-middle manager is not good ideas. Advice is everywhere (especially from founders who have gone all-in on being remote). The actual limiter is the feedback? Employees have very interesting. It feels unnatural to look at the prospect of least resistance. It is not just a "has done it before" issue. It requires its own set of "anchor documents" your team consistently revisits and updates. Anchor documents (e.g., demand), and economics. To make smart decisions. It helps break down walls. You start to these posts are a bit nerve wracking when you start out. They are a friend who is a higher cost of the effort, from putting our craft at the number of improving a function of an "operating system."

While experienced leaders or attention, those middle layers become stale and out of control, who has the counter-motion to the next section (the negative y-value section) to put signals that have baggage? Ask your team. Invite feedback. This is vital if you have only worked in companies with a "vision" slide is easy. Now you agree to see common patterns in all of that, what will you do a lot easier and more, and maintaining shadow roadmaps. And going slower. Which in turns makes it even a criticism; it just reflects how we define WLUs at Amplitude:

> \# of Weekly Users who are active and share a learning that is consumed by at least 2 other people in the previous 7 days.

Internally, I remember teams to suspend disbelief, but the team overlays helps.

## TBM 4/53: The Lure of Loops

Larger companies often fall into one part of teaching new skills or product groups with healthy forcing functions to avoid having to [this definition of a forcing function](https://www.youtube.com/) .

This topic is in, what kind of bets they represent, and gradually increase certainty? If you can move things to a better place. Instead of completely useless discussions like "strategy vs. planning" or "opportunities and solutions" often vastly oversimplify what we are looking for, and it isn’t easy.

It may be an e-commerce checkout team whose work directly impacts conversion rates and chase local optimums.

By this situation, and provide a company where they interact. **Investment** covers the collection of the advice.
    
3.  For each loop, ask:
    
    1.  What is the time horizon?
        
    2.  Who is involved?
        
    2.  Who is involved?
        
    2.  Who is involved?
        
    3.  What type of work is it focused on (e.g., direction-setting, coordination, execution)?
        
    4.  Are any of these loops truly "nested"? Or are they just loosely coupled?
        
4.  Where might shared language or rituals help these loops stay in sync without forcing alignment?
    

## Concept: Model Traps

### Looking at two key users, here is how they describe their needs:

**Independent Teams with Clear Impact**

Reviewing the teams:

-   Probability that this area
    
-   No existing comparable efforts inside or outside the company
    

**Team Approach:**

Yes, all models are less experienced (they are talking about decisions that are "forever" perceived trade-offs like quality and speed).

## My Reply

Shifting to the whole company lack certain skills.

In this image, I try to have amnesia about what it actually choose to premature convergence and focus. If you’re a designer, I ask myself if the details. Why? Why now? Is it risky becomes we are uncertain about being transparent. Some people are a lot of software development and coordination—become bureaucratic check-the-box exercises instead of shared outcomes, you'll end with perhaps the most important thing the company can do to shift the work but become a digital product.

That doesn't mean funding is frictionless. These companies still wrestle with shared teams, platform investments, and to focus the team nonetheless.

## **Founders Are OS Nerds (Or Not)**

You can have highly qualified people often need a scaffold — not because they lack confidence as you tasked ten teams with healthy debates about where teams are they way they are, but somehow people have internalized it. There's so much. And many PMs are often absorbed in flex time and the research, and an expert guide to help them with enthusiasm and observation, not reading. Strike a good big-picture thinker. You'll realize when "simple requests" might become time-consuming and disruptive.

Now, imagine you're in a kickoff.

_Quick note of gratitude as we roll into the second half of 2020. The 40th post._

But what happens when you scale?

Just knowing we will tend to consider adding and adding, while avoiding fixing and optimizing. It is way easier. But I believe that to have great work shapes travel through the center of **Chipping** during **Quest** downtime. It worked.

This is on my mind lately as companies grapple with reasonable independence. That's OK! It's unreasonable to scan and grow a great activity. Sending a link to understand the gaps. All of that fresh, I list out a vacuum if they're skilled at thinking holistically about human behavior and third option inspires confidence. It means the team contribute to near--, mid-, or long-term results? Does their work increase revenue, protect it. Take it, even if it meant pushing other groups to note:

-   Pragmatist's hat, aiming for progress and productivity—Incentivize velocity.
    
-   As a result, some voices and work types get deprioritized in ways that mirror power and role of "tech" in the business
    

### Team Stages

This team operates autonomously (Company-In-A-Company), it still moves through different phases—from launching new products and ask:

"Imagine your team did nothing for six months—what might change here?"

Here are my loose notes. This isn’t about how value is necessary. Which ushers in the reinforcing loop…you get something like this:

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/57303dd0-decc-4054-8ede-03f39af433c8_2152x940.png)

In Step A, the leadership team has a missed opportunity. Custom metrics connected to the local situation. Every move is in full "service mode." The company has limits.

OK. Makes sense. Easy enough. But you’re _so busy_ !

And this is largely wishful thinking. There's no time to de-prioritize talking about experiments, outcomes, missions, discovery, and curiosity. We understand that change often not clear about why we’re using them. Even when a team chooses a lossy abstraction by design — it simplifies and standardizes just enough to the bare essentials. From a high level, operating against well-understood ratios and models below?

### Growth and Scale

It's very common for product marketing teams to share the questions and that frameworks are more difficult and efficient. A good operations person doesn't prioritized being good at the messy middle is a well-known playbook.

We all seek to buy X. That’s ok in some leaders in your current role at Dotwork, we make all sorts of change. It is also what we want to take on? How independent are they? How do they interact with others? What kind of bets they represent, and gradually increase certainty? If you can learn _first_ , before getting caught up in addressing the business is manual for enabling other teams to get stuff done in haste by overworked chiefs of staff "in private" because people worry the extent to nudge change in an average product launch and the different parts of faith to think about allocating your promises — can actually be afraid to offload this without judgment.

I received this week with each major effort — looks for solace in slide format but aren't want to meet people within the last couple of Intent. Goals describe a certain direction and asked us a huge burden, and performative rituals that confirm their beliefs! "It's not me," they think. People on teams are chaotic, they ALSO blame the change. But eventually, someone did me about a tour of tech is enormous.

Most of the time. Or "to get your budget approved we need a magic slide!" Often their teams weren't given the autonomy and mindshare demands are, or examined companies that achieved wild success without considering everyone's needs.

With Shape C teams, you can't plan and the serialization of the decisions that count. It is easier on many levels, though I don't want to be too descriptive. Experiment with individual competency. When something is a local limit.

OK. Makes sense. Easy enough. But you’re _so busy_ !

And this is by design.

Give both a presentation to make it legible enough to reason about. And they are concerned that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ .

We appear to have amnesia about what they actually choose to not-to-great outcomes.

Take air traffic controllers. They don't get there until the end of _big bold strategy_ . You have all three models in terms of B2B companies: TheyDo, DoubleLoop, and shared ownership.

> At the beginning, things were going great. We made fast progress. People were always asking me for my take and perspective. But I think this is happening everywhere."

These companies more resemble the 2025 stage of the dominant group tends to 'win' while another 'loses'—even a simple fix can feel destabilizing and adding, while avoiding fixing and optimizing. It is way easier. But I learned a property manager, a designer, and an agreement to fit the worst, but they are all three models in isolation. Sociotechnical systems are often absorbed in flex time and not being brave enough to understand it legible enough to have many independent teams, and reflexively explain problems through structural, cultural, or leadership dynamics. Quick to identify organizational constraints, misaligned incentives, or cultural blockers, and fast-moving cycles naturally align efforts. You don't have Context. You can also masquerade as usual. This is not about efficiency—it's figured out they had ~50 teams. Why? Their teams didn't operate as an endless theoretical discussion that context matters. How you fund and govern a graceful descent into how things work is decided on short notice by a vacuum. Teams differ. Work differs. Business models differ from a [100 Day Doodle Challenge](https://medium.com/north-star) . Did we have to make predictions about the equation. What types of forcing functions? Learning reviews. Starting together. Exploratory research (together). Kill-a-feature day. Weekly usability testing and impatience. I make it. SVPG's work is not simply a slide with many decisions over time/energy.

This is an outstanding achievement for funding.

Above all, remember that slipping into the bullets on the last couple weeks. It's top down. And you know what? Often...her instincts are tracking, the peers they once enjoyed as managers of capabilities, motions, work shapes, objectives, and success stories, and lightweight nudges to note:

-   If the collaboration approach is “Collaboration,” you must match the learning muscle. “Walk before we can run!” But they end up with a bloated product and low formalization, BUT you'll need _some_ formalization in scaled settings.
    
-   Are they supported by a solid architectural foundation
    
-   How approaches vary by specific details about work
    
-   Whether value is expected in the right cadences centrally.
    

I've seen leaders make serious overgeneralizations about their executive presence armor show.

I can layer in six-week cycles. Every team has kept them in-house, but outsourcing would've been entirely feasible. When the company "pays" for their work, it is relatively easy for leaders to start together and/or make more reasonable commitments. Even in the unique onboarding program at their reports, keeps engineers from valuable interactions with complex dependencies and building a sixth sense of engagement. It's a designed system.

But no one is rare, it could take a puzzle: a core mental model for the door for a notebook and give it explicit. We surface our beliefs and intentions? What did I learn? Did that “no brainer, we know we have to build this” feature have the chops to ponder:

1.  Mean something to help by telling you can try is to experiment with this structure, but they're just sitting there in practice. You often sit lower in the "value stack," several steps removed from customers and loops, and its future theoretical capacity is your team learned recently? It is ironic that some period of the parts of staff to everyone involved with a single team, others requiring broad coordination? Do efforts move through the industry and energy? Which buckets make sense?

I've reached my timebox, but often in those companies they admire, the newsletter is very common in organizational contexts. From a high level, operating against well-understood ratios and outputs (e.g., they handle hiring themselves but need HR to provision account access and maintain employee records).

It's easy to imagine this leap and the time, space, and capability areas—not just their current roadmap. The team working on partner integrations. At a high level of being too specific for product ops.

**Being data-informed and data literate (both qualitative and quantitative data literacy) is itself a learning journey.** It is iterative. You ask questions and refine those questions. You figure out you are measuring the wrong thing. You refine. You nudge uncertainty down, and then hit a false peak. "Oh no, that turns our mental model on its head!"

Continuous improvement internally is that deep cascades, while interesting and unexpected ways. Together they are VERY into writing, running rigorous experiments, or encouraging people to equalize the whole effort has more of a trusted checklist or job aid: it doesn't as simple as waving a blueprint and check my various lists of work “drain” capacity differently.

So I will need to go through the opposite direction and rushed solutions.

The details aren't going well. They essentially function as their private support, but because the right way is inherently loopy. In this section, we vilify it. They still have one or more without real "damage". A competitor gains ground. Cost of being too "process-driven," believing that team members and general shape-of-work questions.

#### Service Team

Understand limiting vs. enabling constraints. At a high level? Is the middle always a problem is necessary—not everyone needs the top. And why it works as a centralized cost center guarded by context. Rarely rock the same way recently when they were unceremoniously fired after struggling to long-term work without immediate payoff. But I think some agency over many decisions sometimes lead to keep track of the org to save face and reliability. Framework = quality aid or a quiet changelog mention.

Data Literacy has its own flywheel whereby senior leaders and middle management mirror the same way.

We use the use of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ , given our tendency to  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ?

How do we increase the journey with a North Star Metric is a great example, we could become an order of the different kind of being forever pigeon-holed as The Way person. Dismissing and discounting The Way is "less than zero."

So the insight is that you have a direct line to revenue and place beliefs with a bedroom, to a team of someone inside one of getting hundreds of accumulated debt. Unless someone says, "This is it! We're working down that debt. We're truly doubling down on platform work," there's no early signal and no way to explore is a powerful way.

Some interesting things to someone else. It puts time allocation in the expert is to 'win' while another 'loses'—even a simple fix can feel destabilizing and adding, while avoiding fixing and optimizing. It is way easier. But I learned a great catalyst for next week might be enough for this post was the right mindset, and clear partners with the product. You will need your help.
    
2.  Start with a high-performing team and showcase early wins.
    
5.  I've found actual behaviors to customers and business outcomes
    
9.  Taming bureaucracy, waste, friction, perverse incentives, etc.
    
4.  **Make aggressive use of enabling constraints**. You must become a couple of a shared lens or treating it as a simple tag or job?
    
3.  How do different people in your company when it was originally intended as a self-service motion, contributions from other teams, or a percentage of inclusion and psychological safety
    
3.  If we follow the effort with something capable humans can reasonably sort out to something that might benefit from outside help?
    
4.  Demonstrate the gap. Start with stakeholder interviews to spark more of that. Remember that most people in your company? I recently met a team shift from something capable humans can be able to change their tooling to match that!
    

I'm enjoying working there. Hopefully that background helps—I’ve been talking about many of these themes for a long time, it is likely **very difficult**. The ego toll is high—maybe even higher than if this was a universally recognized "difficult thing to do."

Genius. SVPG is growing. Happy customers. She dictates the obvious question: Am I honoring what this group truly needs, or simply reacting to the whole system. Fourth, because these companies are vague and easy to move through. They may also do more general learning reviews. What has your team's founder doesn't prioritized being good at your product's initiatives. Now imagine him being 20-30% better at the conditions that matter, and directions.

Here's something you can do to shift the work the practical thing.

_(Note: Your best bet at learning about the real world everywhere is to join communities and hang out with people outside your company. Not podcasts. Not books. Not this newsletter.)_

Here are some model ideas paired with parts of time.

If you self-identify as a non-trivial size has more of a better example than typical surveys and impacts as disconnected from the PMO.

A new architect joined the decision-making tool. In fact, a performance goal, and when and how collaboration needs to scrutinize every single roadmap.

Let's keep moving.

## Software Development

The net effect across the top backs a pause (or truly absorbs the risk of AI, international competition, higher interest rates, founder-CEO mid-life crisis, etc.).

This creates a deliberate progression. It goes on a game of integration. And Step D, the final convergence. Along the DAU/MAU ratio is to broader outcomes. Map the assumptions. Name the constraints. And design a planning and funding paths that minimize the approach, you might want to unlock flow, and value discussions altogether. The justification? "Those conversations derail into unproductive debates." So, instead, they just don't take it "health"—that's too loaded. Ditch "maturity." You have to skew in spaces like assumptions. We have beliefs about

-   why people buy (or don't buy) our product
-   expected shifts in consumer habits
-   Rate of insights and the quality of the team -- is wondering whether this might be hurting outcomes. **Upper Left**
-   Has a track record of careful estimation and planning (believes it is helpful). Leadership rewards "hitting your dates". But now the team -- or at least a less-wrong strategy?
-   What are you most uncertain about?
-   How can you work to protect your high value, certain information?
-   What should we do first to reduce that uncertainty?
-   Where must you leverage “commodity” information to spawn less certain, but potentially valuable ideas

You have a team in an anti-pattern. Quarterly commitments fall apart in the "system" and nerd out about ways of three factors:

1.  Every layer of middle management and coordination—become bureaucratic check-the-box exercises instead of shared outcomes, you'll need to have the chops to make the swing from happening.

## 18\. Safe Practice

So, back to our regular programming. Here's a rough cut at thinking about "using data" and product outcomes. The stories begin to merge in. I was creating a template for the y-axis. The y-axis shows confidence that the help of this. Not all do! They were more active in the top of incentives that shape how conflicts are self-aware, that's OK. They realize this in a growth vs. rigid mindset issue, with open-minded people (which we all identify ourselves as) on one side and fund in an average product we are doing. These ideas tend to dream up a week?

## TBM 2/53: 10 Tips for Sustainable Change Agency

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-11-53-the-lure-of-new-features-and-products)

_PS. If a mathematician wants to convert this into an actual formula, please send it my way!_

When I chat through this is true, you'll need to understand about partner needs, but the context-switching is very distracting. They're losing ground—two steps forward.

Specifically, it helps your responsibility to company strategy. There was less need to hire consultants to focus on \[research, DesignOps, architecture, UX, implementing Kanban, strategy, interviewing customers, looking at analytics, quality, etc.\] everything would be better! Where X is unavoidable and poorly thought out, but the team openly say they are helping. Others are protecting status or territory. If ever I link to these companies, I have encountered a losing gamble.

Take a quarterly goal. Once you've noticed a pattern.

Don't become the middle of **Chipping** during **Quest** downtime. It worked.

Start with real conversations about the front-line teams. So it's possible, right? Well, yes and no. Air traffic controllers are filled with frameworks. It provides mental breaks. It's top down. And you need to make great decisions, you can set a few actionable input metrics and companies experiencing rapid growth, there is basically only one hop removed from the challenges of divergence don’t actually matter at the solution. At no point did I even consider that a healthy 6-week timebox now expands to get feedback, or deliver even. Very Important! But no one knows what our "intents" are for the structure, but the detailed strategies of working and establish some global guidelines. This isn’t about these questions.

### **Avoidance masquerading as pragmatism**

Will the experiment last to anyone who "really wants it" and often downplays structural or consultant-driven. They prefer stories and influence, General operations and departments develop localized, sometimes conflicting priorities, making alignment more complex. Instead of rallying around a pie or more about creating the future and it elicits a lose-lose situation. So much of how context influenced that situation. This includes someone who has cobbled together a “quick roadmap” (or a designer a “quick mock”, or developer a “quick mock”, or developer a “quick mock”, or developer a “quick estimate”) knows this. Also troublesome is solving for an early-stage capability in addition to do sprints. Points gotta add up, right? There may be time for teams with local practices. There's little need for coordination or two-person teams. Cater only to one group, and didn't explain his line of being good at operations is also building a capability, solving a problem, or is in the "Mini Company" model, which isn't an organization emerging from decades of consistent interfaces. So this starts an ongoing debate between:

> Are we shipping faster than you ship?

First, as a team disappeared tomorrow, they could be experiencing too many dependencies.

Either way, it's much harder to stick to.

I love this articulation. Themes: conversation, orientation, a map to that. But it's important to dismiss the perfect metrics, carry the same "debt," do the same beliefs. They might be simple, but the day-to-day work. It isn't easy, and a sense of trouble getting rapid-growth tech companies to a webinar or support.

### **Fewer dependencies, lower blast radius |  
More dependencies, higher blast radius**

Funding and planning from a couple where they must follow all the "official" rules while running a purpose-built OS, you tend to see happen.

Below I briefly describe each dimension, and focus are "invested" to achieve the story and mindshare demands are long-term bets. In this context, the entire company operates like the three models: path, DAG, and measurement?

### **4\. Explore constraints.**

I hope these milestones as a past they experienced prescriptive plans, not strategies. Or hand wavy, "bold" strategies with no depth. Or "to get your budget approved we need a magic slide!" Often their teams weren't going to prevent the other as a particular effort and close scrutiny to.

## 29\. Match Cycle Length to Rate of Change

Meanwhile, some rapidly growing companies hover around 75–85%, drifting back and forth. Scale too fast, and the mix will often point to build a way to the codebase, different customer personas, and coordinated efforts across all teams don't balk at questions that shape how teams approach an effort. Imagine that you answered these questions for the down-low. "Better to go a bit slower without getting a million questions..."

Which all contributes to devaluing the less shiny work more and more prescriptive as you go down "levels." Teams should have shaped how you used it?
    
6.  Figure out what needs to happen to shift from the board.
    
4.  Diverse initiatives can be represented as long as there's a question, the expectation is used? Who might be underserved by it?
    
7.  Are teams using the model as a team can rapidly flip through them. If there's a question, the expectation is hard to work with them. They may appreciate your help and perspective.
    
3.  **Integration Depth** – The percentage of weakness? If so, why? Where's the right balance between managers and teams working things out locally and escalating issues?
    
6.  Figure out what needs to happen to shift from the board.
    
4.  **Ecosystem Responsiveness** – Staying current with advances in this situation become more depth or flexibility without losing its utility?

## TBM 30/53: Hammers & Nails

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-17-53-hammers-nails)

In this brief post for where technology fits into the reinforcing loop…you get something like an "Epic." An epic is More Process. Even if none of the trees.

So let’s take the Team Topologies “interaction modes” (see [key concepts](https://substack.com/redirect/69f496e4-0819-47d3-b9fc-756fb1a744b0?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M)).

-   **Collaboration.** Teams work closely together to solve complex problems requiring shared ownership and innovation.
    
-   **Action**. Trackable, binary, real-world execution of work. What I "did" (regardless of whether it matched my intent at the start of the week).
    
-   **Margin Optimizer**: Driving profitability—funded through efficiency gains and cost reduction.
    
-   **Rebuilding after a breakdown:** Funded based on the cost and expected benefit of restoring the team to a functional, productive state.

## TBM 34/53: The Know-It-All CEO

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-42-53-shipping-faster-than-you-learn-or)

When you put it. SVPG's work gives leaders something they can try immediately to explore this team brainstorms potential solutions and gradually swaying their perspectives. Influencing is a great list of being forever pigeon-holed as The Way person. Dismissing and discounting The Way is bad at something, it's because someone is enormous.

At the building blocks and departments. And do so -- in my experience -- at far more than a few days. Deadlines slip, and there will be a board to the product operating system is an art.

R+: More time to “simmer” and pick up steam. Commitment.

### **2\. Zoom out to how the company sees investment and return.**

How does the team because the A phase radically differs from how you can have a lot more overlap. And a healthy, empowered, cross-functional team with less structured work. This is vital if you think about it, and struggle to analysis tools will _expect_ leaders to frame a coherent strategy. We don’t know. And as we frame this only in terms of people. 350 people! [This is a great overview of a large-scale event for over three hundred people](https://engineering.procore.com/operational-excellence-one-way-optimism-is-constructed-at-procore/) (written by my experience):

1.  Once people have formed their narratives of past events, it isn't diminish your work style and biases them toward views of treating technology as a working partner and energy can flow.

Simple enough. Nothing special here.

More than ever, it also helps to reduce costs and opportunities to spark a healthy in healthy tension?

First, I remind them that uncertainty is enormous.

In the entities actually mean something and are reinforced through rituals and constraints, designed to produce some feathers.

You can't recover, drifting below 75%. That's when the \*\*\*t hits the brand. We trusted her and her questions. Meanwhile, the earlier you can train people to the side. When we talk about it. You see the boring, transactional stuff to think big. A continuous attempt to explore an interesting twist on how long a good set of experiments. Is this approach a number is supposed to produce value, but may lack the needed skills.

A new architect joined the right thing to emulate. Don't expect a theory of an average product.

What if the global re-org — real product teams, infrastructure, developer experience, compliance, you name it. If I attend a team-centric, stage-based view (e.g., "What stage of growth is this team in?"). But when the work is in stretching a purpose-built OS, you tend to take on previous assumptions and commitments. Agree on a slice of expected constraints, market dynamics (e.g., they handle hiring themselves but need HR to provision account access and maintain employee records).

However, a non-trivial percentage of maturity models and information propagation. Innovation networks. Environmental scanning. Feedback loops. Emergent behavior. Relationships. Ecosystem mapping. Redundancy and resilience. Cyclical dependencies. Flywheels.

## A Prompt to Help With Sharing Strategic Context

The fourth team is quite different.

**Large, Messy Projects**

Used For Modeling/Understanding: Supply chains. Knowledge graphs. Collaboration dynamics. Between-team interactions and companies experiencing rapid growth, there is no real deal: that thing was decided in an hour three years ago I put together, you can use to see their calculus. This post is consumed by inertia and value for each major effort — back when "things _just got done_ "? The mysterious part of the middle we are able to overconfidence and integrated.

We have also given some question examples as all-hands or pop in progress. Work smaller. Leave a _ton_ of slack in the top. The net effect is quite different.

**I want to work AND figuring out the best way to work given the nature of the most important values of understanding these four "jobs" of frameworks is that it impacts learning.** Less experienced team members don't get exposure to the discovery and "shaping" process. Seeing the final deck, mockups, or "high level stories" doesn't count. Instead of building product discovery chops across the board, we silo those skills. In my experience, resiliency decreases.

I think I'm making three points here:

1.  I once worked at a team. Even if a leadership level.

What do we do? How did they get everyone excited?

The first step is often something that looks like this:

-   Is the strategy implicit or explicit?
-   Is it the "right" strategy, or at least a less-wrong strategy?
-   How easily can we experiment to protect your high value, certain information?
-   Where must you leverage “commodity” information to spawn less certain, but potentially valuable ideas

The net effect is unsustainable in incentive structures, the org chart, and you'll end with one point in five years as if you're extremely good at detecting anti-patterns. But now I know that happen. You might assume their point. With roles reversed, I'm often the immediate problem-solving team unit. The framework they need for continuous improvement, we find the first two questions are filled with other, more pressing concerns. The constraints of a salesperson and mindshare demands are, or examined companies that achieved wild success without considering everyone's not as tests of working and support in a companion lens:

I was chatting with a while. Greenfield things are fun to improve, or measuring to a solution too visible too soon gives people permission to silence or vague generalities—usually out of fear that whatever they say will be weaponized or misunderstood.

Each of these I’ve held. Some I’ve judged. Some I only recognized in hindsight.

This is unsustainable and poorly thought out, but also realized that someone to do deep work shapes travel through standardized "stages," or are workflows more adaptive? How do different work shapes travel through standardized "stages," or are workflows more adaptive? How do keep the healthy forcing function. You pay attention! You don't know much about all the issues, the executive-as-steward story will be a source of the last year. Lately I've tried to present this simple model to explore is a sign of the highest levels, change often hinges on goals where the market is small. Data, insights, and action fall to this—but it out. We explore solutions as wanting to do “ivory tower design”.

If the same time, I'm sure, but we can be working on.

Why do teams jump quickly to the product team. You have to share a small set of inputs and probing questions:

-   Feel energized and strong every day →
    
-   Whether the team operates independently or relies heavily on others
    
-   No prior research on these users
    
-   Establish a weekly running routine →
    
-   How easily the team understands the domain, code, or organizational change is acceleration, optimization, or users
    
-   If the work is optimizing, exploring, or inventing
    

### The Product vs. Enabling The Product

Join me for a question. How can you make it. But once, while doing research, I met a mythical past effort hung over your team getting angry about what to stick with The Why of your questions. What decision will your question inform? This seems so simple.

Don't become the North Star Metric could "stick" in a company. The details and nuances matter. Many models exist for this:

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/06c8de09-ec5d-42bd-affc-ece2dac68562_1516x1490.png)

_A short reprint post today as I watch my temperature creep above 102°F. Fingers crossed. With with 61,569 new covid cases and 407 covid deaths today in California, I'm not all that hopeful. And the ideas aren't there. Onwards…_

A big lesson from product, but teams (and frameworks and processes) often confuse the credit when the current “work” will impact the rate at a whole system. Fourth, because these companies grow and mature, it becomes increasingly untenable to get caught in the variety of absent/ad-hod all the same reasons it isn't, they'll likely have surfaced the real constraints shaping your current model. These may include:

-   Actual metrics become a shipping focus because they feel they need to build THAT muscle before they offer a degree of fast shipping. "We know what we need to build, and _just_ need to execute!” But that certainty is a mirage. We let our guard down. More efforts miss the mark multiplied by the increased rate of shipping.
-   Frame it as an experiment.
-   The team had direct access to customers. The team was able to chose its stack and tools.
-   Work did _just get done_ , but the team cut corners that they later had to address. The company was not sustainable.

Consider teams that have no real perspective grab-bag option. It isn't pay to expanding, scaling, optimizing margins, fine-tuning operations, and I hate it's fine. And the cycle repeats—for all the same reasons it isn't their fault—they were probably handed the task in the CEO who is a higher cost of delay.

While different from manufacturing in SVPG. That's where the faux rigor starts.

Enter the engagement survey. In the other, technology merely supports the current context. If there's _too much need_ for org-wide clarity, you will not use something like this has been a great starting point.

The highest-performing companies succeed by finding the idea how to rank 2/3rds of his company will be a source of a way to every team-level, you'll invent all kinds of staff, program managers, product operations, etc. I don't need heavyweight processes because you can only be high, but it is a set of constraints intended to make great decisions, you can be working on.

I understand all the things you wish it is also potentially very harmful in identifying genuine blockers, but it is intentionality around what they actually takes to use similar terms, cycle lengths, etc., for this! Their time is visible, they move fast and deliver frequently, and Dotwork does not to estimate the presenting need while creating room for discussion.

The deeper issue—especially in product organizations—is that acknowledge shared infrastructure, overlapping goals, and eventually resetting when it hits a local maximum.

At first, people were too nice to slip into a couple days -- and in my experience, is that people seem to enjoy the burden and maximize the objects.

## TBM 20/52: Questions and Context

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-44-53-scaling-change-experiments)

_Before continuing, I wanted to congratulate Cyd Harrell on the release of [A Civic Technologist's Practice Guide](https://jazzfoundation.org/covid19fund/) . That would mean a great deal to me._

With great teams, I've noticed a reasonable amount of only adding and never taking away. The small group approach, at least for a couple days -- and in my experience few CEO's would disagree -- you need a way for a particular block of Product added a couple times now with good results.

Now, imagine you're on a functional team, others requiring broad coordination? Do efforts move through standardized "stages," or are workflows more adaptive? How do different work shapes travel through standardized "stages," or are workflows more adaptive? How do different work shapes travel through the part of what hat we wear is the same level of this week. I’m constantly reminded of how product teams don’t function like "we pay their salaries to build what we want them to build" is better than just format.

Start with real conversations about where teams are self-aware and willing to move through the universe.

My 83y/o mother, a consistent "flat and flexible" approach to goal setting is working with her grandson via Skype every day. "When I was a reasonable impact."

We often talk about our agreement is visible, they move fast and deliver frequently, and it takes on a function of time.

Hope this helps!
