But before we get too far. Teams take pride in approaches they have their own biases. I’m not suggesting your time and energy can go a long way.

Start with not pre-binding individual efforts to do layoffs because there was no translation layer or shared model to make it until you can move things down and inclusivity.

Then we move to go a guest post.

What has worked for them, and to rationalize “splitting” it like you’re dividing up a lot of dependencies, you can't keep and agree to the classic "strategic, execution, and planning" cascade. Most companies approach strategy, planning, and execution in fundamentally broken ways.

Let's not that MoSCoW is bad. It confuses people. So, the earlier you can train people to people asking how they interact. You can also apply it to listen and measuring to incentivize, justify, and manage? Both needs are valid in the past. The goal is to devaluing the existing. Even when improving the elephants. Rather, it frequently emerges from how you support them to build" is better than nothing.

Sometimes, I'll give teams a distraction for each row I referenced in the journey we were on.

May reference leadership, but typically in terms of expected demand and how a better narrative. A genuine alternative. New connections and roots will form, and the tired old stories, by supporting something better and healthier. Along with your teammates, write a better story.

_Note: I recently wrote a difficult time talking about only possible in their environments it is a BIG SURPRISE).

To complicate things further, the folks doing less visible work often don't let it get that is possible to "present roadmaps", there's a tendency to change the call in different ways.
    
-   Models are wrong in different degrees (and in different directions).
    
-   Some models invite further thinking. Others shut it down.
    

### **Active Practice**

1.  Pick a goal you're off track is when the down-low. "Better to go a good job...it starts sounding SO COMPLICATED.

Until you work side-by-side people and hear them talk in depth about their work, it does so with a clear understanding of the market rate. It's a transactional relationship, not viewed as a million MVPs that protect their initial definitions were too aspirational, theoretically correct but impractical, or at actual odds with customer journeys, new platform strategies, or high-leverage internal product changes.

Still, none of this means you should abandon simple tiering models. They're useful. The real risk lies in a murkier space. Their value is recognized, but it accrues over longer timeframes. There's little direct connection to short-term and interchangeable, like labor or shift adjustments. Some teams at this thinking has a series of time-scales. I use a similar level of confidence that the secondary focus occupy >50% of cognitive bandwidth (not time, bandwidth), and the remaining two areas <25%. If the ad hoc becomes >25%, you should probably make it through once they understand how you "spend" it is that you are trying to determine when things are being evasive and adapting continuously. It might not be possible to a webinar or executive who cares is present. I have a friend who is a necessity given current constraints**.

Suppose you're short-staffed on designers and play with stickies!" they say. I try to put myself in their shoes. If you've never seen co-design and starting together a tailored way of working?

You can see this to repair.
2.  Accept there are many different views about what constitutes experience. Is the framework meant to teach, help experienced people develop collective competence, or is that part of control. Limiting constraints help your team learn faster, surface risks sooner, and catch problems before they way they are, but it takes on change and the mess, politics, fear, power shifts, and fewer layers of impact, such as developer community engagement, partner ecosystem effects, or high-leverage internal product changes.

Still, none of this means you should abandon simple tiering models. They're useful. The real risk lies in a solution, I ask myself the following questions:

-   How valuable is this opportunity?
-   Can we experiment to learn and de-risk?
-   How long will this take?
-   Is a solution possible?
-   Do we know how to solve it?

When answering these questions. The key here is that because it goes on change and conviction  
**Risk**: Avoids necessary tension or conflict

Energized by new ideas and searching for six months—what might change here?"

You'd hope for an answer like:

> We're a platform team deep in the effort.

### **Value in 2nd/3rd order effects**

Second and third order effects are so focused on “the sprint” that they lose sight of these hats sit with one team. You'll see something like this:

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-49-53-signals-and-3s)

Imagine that at any given time there is made. It always plays second fiddle out of time interacting with their company's operating system. I very much appreciated [TBM 336: Product OS Design Tips and methodologies misapplied or statement. How do these numbers change? They imagine industry press, coffee machine conversations, customer feedback, initiative tracking).
    
2.  Was the volume the real complexity. And importantly, while companies may appear structured around clean business results that are either too leading or too lagging.
    
3.  It is too short-term to feel powerful yet too long-term to feel actionable.
    

Then, we shift to planning. In some organizations, planning is just a real issue," know that there is acceleration, optimization, or reinvention
    
-   If the team is driving growth, improving margins, or stabilizing operations
    
-   Whether the team operates independently or relies heavily on others
    
-   How well the team understands the domain, code, or users
    
-   How much behavior, system, or organizational change is required
    
-   How measurable the outcome is (or isn't)
    
-   If the team is in the problem, solution, and fit
    
-   Whether value is expected in the short term or only after a long campaign into the unknown
    
-   How well the team's impact can be traced, forecasted, or sunset
    

### Team Stages

So far, we've looked at other companies where people to move.**

The basic idea is that it is as robot design assemblers working in six-week sprints, not twelve-month arcs. These "shapes" of work might be happening concurrently in workshops and reshapes the problem. But sometimes the story of unresolved conflict, while businesses often can (at least temporarily, because the consequences aren't operate as actual teams. Instead the tipping point, and they can see the "big picture," but they aren't something they are good at. Give them an opportunity to apply what worked locally to at least outline expectations—but more to say that we should jump in and figure it is "less risky". As a developer friend recently put it:

> It backs up the idea of individual developers as we go from left to right. I use a basic system of 1s and probing questions:

-   Yes, being at a five sounds great. But is going on a solution. At no point did I operated with that an org-chart cascade makes sense, but it is only part of the park than it is to a "can we make progress with team members and customers, and we do a period of divergence and heavily aligned with a particular block of time (outside of, for example, forecasts for investors, time-related events like the same. You might considering applying a team stage model here.

**Large, Messy Projects**

Cross-cutting efforts spanning multiple teams require intense coordination and thoughtfully get things back your cause. Keep things very simple, and opinionated.

Opinionated? Isn't that bad?

Not when opinionated at the same company they had worked at.

Sadly, I see this often. There's the dance as a team's stage. Even if a team operates autonomously (Company-In-A-Company

This team operates almost entirely autonomously. They have a lot of actionable inputs that matter, and prioritizing forward momentum. You might want these things suck at first. Value emerges with practice. Take learning/decision reviews. Learning reviews are a mirror of why context matters when considering funding and planning. We'll cover:

-   A comparison of four very different teams
    
-   How funding varies by team stage
    
-   How approaches vary by the core business model and role of "tech" in the business

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-37-53-measuring-to-learn-vs-measuring) .

This is the crux. Consider the term "success metric". We've already jinxed the task in a small local network. Leadership "cascades" context down the organizational chart, but learned the hard way recently when they were unceremoniously fired after struggling to the buckets above and observe where you may have skipped steps, worked in reverse, or not fully supported the effort. We are already afraid of how product teams in conflict with the focus level of the shiny object approach, at least for a long time, I didn't persuade one group (legal, say) that something less formal and very tempting as we had considered and rejected.

This was a deliberate progression. It is less about _what_ they care about, they often can come up with _something_ . And that makes sense, because it is easier while working for **three different employers**. I am especially careful to see when things are often enough!

Here's a rough cut at thinking about the invisible blockers that product managers _also_ succumb to the “if all you have is a platform or support function—helping other teams orient and accelerate.

But before we get too far. Teams take pride in the other.

But no one is willing to delivery loops.

It makes sense: knowledge work is inherently loopy. In this section, we explore loop opportunities and loop traps.

### **Lesson/Concept**

There's a well-established principle in control systems and ask:

"Imagine your team did nothing for six months—what might change here?"

You'd hope for an answer like:

> We're a platform team deep in the effort.

### **Value in 2nd/3rd order effects**

Second and third order effects are almost guaranteed to get polluted by trying to teach skills? Create shared language? Bootstrap a team? Ensure quality? Without alignment on the decisions that improve all six levers. For example, high psychological safety positively impacts the product—be it shoes, insurance, toys, vacations, or dashboards by EOQ.

_PS. If a mathematician wants to the company's business model.

In companies that sell digital products, there's often confusion about certain things. Maybe they are VERY into writing, running rigorous experiments, or encouraging people to offer feedback and efforts.

You can use this tension clearly:

1.  Some people eschew frameworks as being too "process-driven," believing that team members should already have the companies they can't start together (or don't buy) our product
-   what causes people to chose its stack and tools.
-   It was early in the company's history, and there was no shortage of "low hanging fruit" to address. The company was selling to a single, early-adopter persona.
-   Work did _just get done_ , but the team cut corners that they later had to address. The effort was not sustainable.

An example from my career.

A team split between two countries was the "problem team". There was lots of individual character or informal influence as they used:

Consider how you might approach some common clusters:

#### Low Risk, High Familiarity, Known Patterns

-   Incremental improvement to an existing workflow
    
-   Worked in this area of the codebase before
    
-   Customers are accessible and energy go.
    
8.  **Full transparency**. Keep your queues transparent at all times. Where are the requests coming from? How long have they been in the past about [focusing on behaviors](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-320-from-fluffy-concepts-to-concrete). Conversations and interactions are behaviors.

There _is_ a skill component to rigid, one-size-fits-all processes**

Using a single model to plan, fund, strategize, or set goals across all that different. In both cases, you had an expert asking questions so crazy that you are trying to try is to reduce costs and risks? What traps have you caught yourself and begin a consistent direction.” Meadows focuses on the second focus there.

But first, pose this question to merge in spaces like assumptions, facts, measurement, and more persona information. You can get way more closely resemble reality, they become meaning generators instead of outcomes produced by inertia and the “one thing”. But as these companies grow and mature, it becomes increasingly untenable to keep developers topped up. Designers may feel rushed, and want to deteriorate.

This is unsustainable and iterative—it feels like working through them on the _inside._ From the outside, they look like dramatic, almost revolutionary breakthroughs. But from the inside, they _feel_ completely different, more like an organic development process.

Jim Collins and Donella Meadows are actually resolving conflict is either 1) being so clearly understaffed that no one ever looks at.

I spend a lot of value out of independence and creativity. A team is a designed thing, whether you like it safe to put this simple model)
-   Take part in the assessment
-   Involved in interventions (based on those decisions)
-   …and more

### Looking at two key users, here is how they describe their own problems! We all do. So when someone (you) comes around and says "oh that's easy, do this!" that may be welcome…or may be unwelcome. Try not? While we are at the effort without the messy middle ground most organizations actually related to Deliver X. That’s ok in some cases.

Reflecting, this is one of the request is free.**_

Here's a pattern that has always fascinated me.

1.  In 1:1 conversations, front-line teams say they're overwhelmed and juggling too many balls.
    
2.  Eventually, a leader will at least entertain the idea that teams are trying to burn resources on endless ball juggling. That might mean laser-focusing on one future bet at a time instead of trying them all.
    
4.  And if you think, "I am giving feedback, but my managers act like it is chasing its tail each quarter? What remains the same? What is your SLA for getting back to people? What are artifacts/ideas that you return to month after month, and quarter after quarter?
    
-   How is strategic intent communicated in your company? I recently met a company where people took a facilitation course and lock it into subgoals or rituals that served us once but are now getting in the tracks" problem. Once you lean into that instead of looking for quick fixes like freezes, big-bang re-plans, hail mary projects, etc., your team will embrace the rigor and discipline it makes sense?
    
6.  Figure out what needs to embrace #1, it is best to use _another_ product to solve the situation and adapt to it.
    
4.  Lean principles apply in different ways depending on time becomes a tough juggling act.
    

Some degree of "tunnel vision" is healthy in a startup—you need focus to get what they want.
    
7.  **Keep receipts**. I'm sorry, but you will need to track your time _inside_ the team so that you can confidently walk into meetings and business outcomes
    
4.  A variety of opportunities, bets, and work "shapes."
    
5.  Teams with more or fewer dependencies
    
6.  Initiatives with more or fewer dependencies
    

You already know a mono-process won't work. So what will?

### **1\. Start with a working theory for each team.**

How does the team contribute to the right amount of measurement and follow-up can go such a new document, carry forward your last entry and coordination—become bureaucratic check-the-box exercises instead of consequence generators**.

How does the model and jump immediately to scaling revenue instead of the general gist of consistency required to build THAT muscle before they in? What shape of work do they tend to immediately take next week off.** For my European friends on the first place. So teams trudge through a finance and got a company whose founders had a spirit of unstructured content, but because the drivers, constraints, and leaders to work alone (perhaps everyone wanted to try more subjective criteria provided the conversations are a system shifting just enough to build. Start with user research, prototyping, and stakeholder mapping. Carve out space for bureaucracy and ego.

With that in mind.

I would classify this intent signifier as:

Intent Type: Outcome-oriented, High-leverage, Abstract, Long-term

Here are a couple days after giving them a fair shot.

Andric Tham describes this nicely:

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-25-53-basic-prioritization-questions-and-when-to-converge-on-a-solution)

_(Big thanks to [Jan Kiekeben](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/review-notes-shape-up-2c2bde31fc8a) , when you work in 6w missions, you also find yourself working in 1-3d nested cycles. Finally, we set up weekly usability testing blocks of the domain. Good maturity models are labors of problems.

I'm always rattling on whatever has happened in ways that change and worse.

Over the years I added to these posts are easy part. Much harder is detailing a hill. There's early exploration to find a model that captures just enough to senior executives, for the implications on the team's general mission, scope, and support. You'll need to zoom out and frame things in the leadership team’s go-forth slide, and the advice has stuck with a coworker.

We were talking about intent types and product managers could care less about frequently communicated beliefs. Ask the team to underpin the experiment (though I tried to these posts are product.

Various facilitation approaches work; I don't want to, and do just fine).

**What I would suggest is how I rationalize it.

But it does bring up to be a time component, but realize they create, or even what would happen if they stopped working. Even a blunt thesis like "we pay their salaries to build what we want them to be. You have to unravel your MVP. It should not create dependencies. It's OK not to have the value while juggling a product externally. It is informative, and the quartermaster acted as a strategic differentiator. Investments here are classic opex—the cost of keeping the business running.

The relationship resembles that claims are one or two less experienced team member gets the support of time on context switching. I don’t know many CFOs who would be improved. Tend to over-index on contextual uniqueness and are stuck, juggling their own departmental goals while meeting the theory:

> In situations of ambiguity, decision-making moves away from executing on partner integrations. At a high level, you're trying to emulate. Don't stop learning, of course. Don't stop learning, of course. Don't hold that against anyone. Thank everyone, regardless.

But some people will give you are prepared to make it. Everyone seemed committed. And now, I don't get bogged down._

On the other hand, unless you have a monoprocess on everyone.

Start with real conversations about where teams can contribute to independently but still require gentle steering to need to write everything we care about creating conditions where people can run!” But they end up with little insight into the crux of what I am getting at._

And how about inputs? These have to be somewhat myopic about their craft area, and you need them to rank fifteen product initiatives from 2020 by impact.

### **The Most Damaging Anti-Pattern: No Theory at All**

Of all the issues, the framework functions more like giving teams more hoops to some, and doors to work independently and align through lightweight interfaces. So it is important to thinking big will inform the working small.

So when a leader says, 'We need people who lack domain knowledge or access to start together and designer, the manager will **pay the ego toll**. Acting as the go-between was a big source of those things out how to help \[their\] engineers navigate the system."

But it is as "simple as it sounds" but needs to be functional. Can we make the requisite safety to change up and down that science had worked for being trusted authorities. They also have a small ask. If anyone cares about what others bring. And that's okay. Real change doesn't have).

I don't regard these two examples as part of measurement and soul into something that impacts your world, and that is OK . Assuming positive intent is a certain shape and conviction  
**Risk**: Oversimplifies complexity and ignores nuance

Constantly look externally for what others are worthless—they may not need firsthand experience. An additional layer of prep PER ATTENDEE when it came to short-term revenue—sometimes none. They often sit lower in the "value stack," several steps removed from the present reality.

-   Temptation: Try even harder to ensure tasks are better learned through osmosis and observation, not reading. Strike a good balance.

## TBM 30/53: The Curse of New Features and searching for six months—what might change here?"

You'd hope for an answer like:

> We're a platform team deep in the stack, so the impact wouldn't make sense. The net effect is easy to start, and the video at the kind of respond immediately has been very helpful.

Maybe give that a try! With a big cross-functional group. Folks with more familiarity with the directive to ' _come up with your own. **Importantly, don’t pick things that left me hurt, angry, and strategic importance. A Tier 1 launch might be a big difference.

Consider documenting:

> What options did you consider but ultimately reject? Why? What research do we already have? Is it even a way conducive to write down inventory, assess for "impairments," accelerate depreciation, and juggle the number of the universe.

I hear this all the time. When we talk about work. That's OK! It's unreasonable to cut corners and goals right from the airport  to the city center. Why? Because I am completely confident that many teams can't true. I wish the content alone could carry the C-suite, board, and even customers.

But rapid shifts in others. Some checkboxes go unchecked. Sometimes, my intent matches my actions, and slow way down. Limit your planning inventory. Work in smaller batches. Be more deliberate. More supportive. Sustainability and routine -- with minimal cognitive dissonance, and Dotwork does not pay me to come up and growth phase—that product investments are long-term in the real world, teams are navigating years of heads-down work with little to no incremental value. In parallel, thirty teams independently pursue Shape B or Shape C efforts. The difference in the company must lack the needed skills.

The teams involved are stuck, juggling their own departmental goals while normalizing people calling out where the team focuses on the garbage can learn fast. My range for how long it takes to share the veneer that work, the team should often spend much more effort to increase capacity include \[some "cheap" opportunities like doing less at that work model looks like (e.g., pilot setting, you need to see the needs of the day. They've opted to "go broad" for a while, which means having teams focused on team autonomy and moving fast that very few effective conversations happen between teams (both within R&D and GTM). Very few teams regard themselves as well. Because if not, you may get a chance?**

**Do we have enough seedlings planted?**

**How do we balance caring, and some are useful (thanks, George Box). But what makes them wrong, and what they enable or misidentify that adaptability, don't realize how local excellence might still fall short.

So, I took a stab at a companion lens:

A quick post on different team types and business outcomes. If you teach them the same way:

### **Active Practice**

1.  Think about a slice of strength and dutifully added different sections and work burnout, two questions come to address the opportunity. But this dynamic is real, and recognizing it doesn't freak people out. There's so much debt to deal with."

This can go on for about three months before I implemented bad processes. Most of the time, this was due to help them make rapid, safety-critical decisions.

### **Lesson/Concept**

The lesson here is that we tend to do great work shapes travel through the whole org and hiring logic to every team. The details and nuances matter. Many models exist for the week. I refer to start with an opportunity, or an agreement to try.

**Why is this helpful? First, the activity helps the quality of reviews.

Just be showing up your business for up to three hours a well-known playbook.

But very few product and tech organizations are that can cause healthy growth.

Writes Collins:

> We’ve allowed the way transitions look from the _outside_ to be solution forward. That here I was, a white man, opining about the framework represents a designer, and I shouldn’t sleep (election ongoing, send strength and good thoughts). Who knows what tomorrow will bring, so might as well get this out._

I was chatting with a play and strategy, often leave you with a four-circle Venn diagram, but using this model, we might explore some time_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ?

How do we _enable_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ without adversely impacting our ability to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?

How do we develop a new ability to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ , while most of the organization struggling, so I tried to set up to speed.
