# CLAUDE.md - Reference Agent Guidelines

## Step 1: Install UV (Python Package Manager)

### Testing
- Up to 8 filter expressions
- Multi-agent workflows
- Refresh buttons on all branches
- Enterprise API: $500-5K/month
- Autonomous risk assessment
- State passed correctly between agents
- UI components are "best-effort" - may drop events under `backend_py/.env`; never commit overrides. Keep Azure/Gemini keys optional so fallbacks work.
- Do fix:
  - Run `gofmt` (or `go fmt`) and organize imports.
  - log follow-ups as TODOs/issues rather than expanding the current task.
