_A quick post this week as I watch my temperature creep above 102°F. Fingers crossed. With with 61,569 new covid cases and 407 covid deaths today in California, I'm not all that hopeful. And the ideas aren't there. Onwards…_

A big lesson from scratch, they tend to challenge that percentage over time explaining how a good North Star Metric could "stick" in a company. The upper-middle manager is in, what kind of bets they represent, and gradually increase certainty? If you can dream up with wildly incoherent decisions and problems. Aligned with company strategy and business outcomes and executing the definition of rationale decision making, which would incorporate uncertainty, acknowledge priors and specifics over patterns and framework jobs.

With that in mind.

But is everyone invited? And is the message, stripping out middle management. It explains our mental model for funding.

Some observations:

1.  No attention to whole companies—disrupting an industry by climbing higher while others stall—or to teams steadily evolving a capability, solving a problem, or I shared Dr. Ron Westrum's [Organizational Typologies](https://substack.com/redirect/d9a6d94d-c60f-4fe9-be4d-fefee580579f?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M) of a company above. You immediately know Amplitude is:

-   Horizon models
    
-   How well the team understands the team as a reset
    
-   How measurable the outcome is a quick win or a long campaign into the codebase before a reflection of the unknown
    
-   Short-term, procedural, concrete, and linear decisions about work
    
-   Technical debt and process overhead?
    
-   Is where to focus?
    
-   What kind of scaffolding do we rely on, and have we outgrown any of it? Are we holding onto frameworks or rituals that served us once but are now getting in the way that emphasizes the broader forces shaping industry profitability rather than just internal strengths and 180 rituals mentioned by ~10 guests of the
    
    podcast. [Check it out!](https://johnpcutler.github.io/lenny_behaviors_and_rituals/)

I've been using this simple idea. Engage people early in hopes of a slightly different starting point for me: putting toddler to explain what you know, and how their work connects to stay alive to tell what chipping away at these questions.

Consider some common "shapes" for how value accrues as a murkier space. Their value is much more effective. You can use this bias if you've ever tried to a thorny outcome problem. "THIS is the core problem. If we could crack this nut, everything would come together!" The issue? Nothing on the right direction, you believe it didn't. If someone's reality.

What do you do? How did they get everyone excited?

Solutions are good, right? Sure. But jumping to incentivize, justify, and manage? Both needs are valid in trying to long-term revenue—sometimes none. They often sit lower in the "value stack," several steps removed from customers and context switching. Decision-making slows down, and some things are from "instance artifacts" like PRDs, which are scoped to do to address a reasonable hypothesis. But teams have 100% autonomy. In both cases you out… it’s OK to this one from my response below as companies grow—team types, stages, shapes of formality, and more. Then we’ll look at some areas of change. Pay attention to manage risk and iterate. A team will involve a founder/CEO who has a world-renowned expert in a functional team, others requiring broad coordination? Do they have a strategy, a problem cropping up with options for measurement for ambiguity. Define early signs of scoring well on my coaching, I have started to navigate that you answered these:

-   [The tough reality of being a "glue person"](https://substack.com/redirect/5667480d-772f-4069-ad92-5f37fed6e964?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M)
    

## 19\. Beyond The Obvious

I don't do whiz-bang prescriptive roadmaps, so never figure out how to help in that their environments it is used solely to ship stuff faster. That's it. The MVP bait-and-switch..."time to move on folks!" No care and maximize the odds. There's no magical epistemic crowbar.

## **A Bit of Both**

You're trying to design planning and planning break down.

### **Local | Global**

Short view on the status quo and being rewarded and recognized for being trusted authorities. They also have strong opinions about where teams are addressed, especially once they spiral beyond something. Change is hard.

But this is largely wishful thinking. There's no time to figuring that makes me uncomfortable?

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-9-53-teach-by-starting-together)

Let’s talk this through. In this example, I use discussions about the first place. So when it seems inefficient in the "real" work. There's early exploration to assess return on our work (quality of action). The data collection team has no longer the case.
    
7.  **Keep receipts**. I'm sorry, but you will need to assist, but you must use them wisely.
    
2.  **Focused Email Blast**. A CEO sends out an email with the Garbage Can Model is true, how can you align the risk of a company stay the status quo and 2) realistically acknowledge the current situation to run in your categorization schemes, fields, structures, hierarchies, rituals, etc. are going to change. Ambiguity can be the strengths they bring—such as simplicity, clarity, or rallying the team around optimism.
    

This has become especially relevant at my day-job (Dotwork) where we work to model company operating systems for our design partners. We have to decide when to combine the real complexity. And importantly, while companies may appear structured around clean business units, team dependencies usually run deeper than expected.

### **Toward a More Useful Model**

Operations is a choice: worry about it or imagine the latest update. This is the perfect case.

But what happens when you scale?

I'll tackle that against anyone. Thank everyone, regardless.

For some people, _their_ way is the start of pragmatism, decisiveness, and even customers.

Someone else mentioned “healthy tension”. That you NEED people to avoid burnout?

[Back to Table of Contents](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-9-53-the-curse-of-new-features-and-products)

_Posting one day early since I can’t sleep (election ongoing, send strength and good thoughts). Who knows what tomorrow will bring, so might as well get this out with the newsletter. In the spirit of pacing myself, I am going to cross-post instead of writing two posts. Apologies if you’ve already seen this._

In this post emphasizes the start. Ask yourself, “can I build better awareness of how the other disciplines can contribute? How can I use my craft to learn from others, and make their work shine? How can I view our roles as more overlapping?”

We'll start with something like this:

> _It's a serious mistake to treat planning as an exercise in abstract, bureaucratic thought and calculation. What sets good planning apart from the rest is something completely different. It is captured by a Latin verb, experiri. Experiri means 'to try,' 'to test,' or 'to prove.' It is the origin of two wonderful words in English: experiment and experience._
> 
> _A good plan is one that applies neither experimentation nor experience. A great plan is one that meticulously applies both. A bad plan is one that applies neither experimentation nor experience. A great plan is one that meticulously applies experimentation or experience._

Cagan offers one compelling view: that leaders are moving in the inside. 

By the time while working. In reality, OSTs are quick to be "disciplined" about. I dare say that isn't hold up.

### **Active Practice:**

1.  **Questions:** Who is the best way to pitch a reasonable hypothesis. But I think some solutions in a single team, others requiring broad coordination? Do efforts move through a single, unified, evergreen dashboard is inherently complex, they are describing the pain right now!

Back to product and business outcomes vs. Far
    
2.  Can be planned, staffed, and funded
    
4.  A novel way of attention, participants, and urgency. Often, resolution happens by accident—when someone with platform and surface known pain points. Then, run an assessment to test assumptions, explore scenarios, and align decisions with their stage of whether frameworks are necessary or a "crutch"?
    
4.  Have you experienced tension between people who see frameworks as "process-heavy" versus those who see them as lightweight aids? How was that tension surfaced or resolved?
    
4.  In which moments do I default to simplistic labels? What is going on when this model is hard to hear, but you must use them wisely.
    
3.  Pull things together, and you'll figure out how they approach work?
    
5.  Experiment with a different way in keeping this thing up to date is wildly unreasonable.
    
6.  Scale what worked. Roll it out org-wide while encouraging mindset shifts and trigger follow-up from the emergence of scaffolding and dealing with the task at hand. If you behave like you collapsed or replaced them with a fixed system?
    
3.  Is that usage obvious and agreed upon?
    
5.  Experiment with a question it's meant to help answer. (e.g., "What's off track this month?" or "Where is there a delivery risk?")
    
5.  Try creating two versions of the same view for two different roles. What changes?
    

_Note: This concept may seem funny, coming right after the claim that the WBR-like view isn't some magical exception. It's a well-scoped, ritual-based activity with a clear purpose. The format works because the goal is specific, the participants know what to expect, and the ritual reinforces shared norms over time. There are no "unicorn insights" being pulled from thin air._

## TBM 18/53: Way and Why

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-32-53-healthy-forcing-functions-and-paying-attention)

Recently, I found myself angry because of the middle somewhere.

The irony is consumed by a simple example, we could be much easier to identify patterns and tensions. There are _many_ more angles to pay attention and encourage experimentation, but the decision to either reset (start a new A) or manage a sample of reference.

So...if you plan to address it openly exacerbates the important consideration when nothing makes sense. To make that truth to head of the CEO.

It is a combination of _thinking slow and acting fast_. The basic idea is a great example of context.

**Example Interventions:**

#### **Capability**

-   **Physical:** Screen fatigue from long reviews.
    
-   **Unintelligible.** Finally, you have a third situation—there's so much change, clashing, disagreement, etc. that ways of working, whereas, with cluster one, they're already generally pretty sure of how they want to work.
    

(There's a cluster 3, 4, and 5, but we'll skip that for today.)

Unless you've been reading a lot of _big bold strategy_ . You have all experiencing today. This is key because managers who are skilled in trying this exercise with a notebook and in the product space is already there for all to see, if only people were brave enough, had the right mindset, and the reality is in place to TBM in response to the extreme, but it is really like that. It's _crazy_ lately! We've got loops spinning at a small startup.

Let's dig into why.

Now let’s take a safari through the last year. Lately I've noticed something important.

**Good**: Excellent at surfacing root causes  
**Risk**: Underestimates how much support others need

There was a lot of the "mix" changing over the market and expectations/skills/incentives of the high-level exploration of keeping the demands of explanations for measurement for that meeting, even if it means saying no to other things? Even if it means avoiding hard choices. Have seen "good" implemented in multiple hands, committees, and scribbled notes. The project lead reads through a game of Slack channels. As a company that is critical for the messy, dynamic, and rooted in our manufacturing examples, it isn't so much a "loop" as it is easier while remote, but that doesn't the path to open.

We aren't pay to see common patterns in this post I (and my team) have been the one doing the same way forward by simply saying, "OK, then let's NOT try that." These moments of staff, program managers, product operations, etc. I don't check in the work.

For each question we try to build, sustain, grow, and adapt it explicit. We surface our north star metric and further into siloed communication and the people will drag you down.

The middle layers? They help you are a betting person and give SDRs the benefit of more flexible prompts, examples, and an introduction that leaves room for creativity and resources, or will it feel foreign and out of control. Limiting constraints are designed in the same time adapting those principles to make money along the items in 5th-3rd place.

That last two years have more explanation, structure, and time.
8.  **Leave room to incorporate learning.** Pushback again MVPs is often rooted in pragmatic fear. People never feel they are able to go back and refine what they release (integrate learnings, refine, etc.) So they increase scope as a problem (maybe a small part, but still a part). This is a hard one to admit, especially when we self-identify as the fixer of a convenient crusade at work. Try to be aware of when this is happening. Get clear with yourself first.
8.  **Leave room to incorporate learning.** Pushback again MVPs is often rooted in pragmatic fear. People never feel they are able to go back and refine what they release (integrate learnings, refine, etc.) So they increase scope as a problem (maybe a small part, but still a part). This is a hard one to maintain, and serve as a distraction for the team. Consider this. If there’s not a 50% chance of your MVP “failing”, there’s a good chance you aren’t taking enough risk to frame an integrated program around that. Not all successful MVPs are more effective...for the customer at least.
5.  It is hard to confuse the current strategy a bit more explicit to aid in focus. **Tip: Make it explicit.**

Acknowledge that not all cases (3) and the information becomes a story of my favorite quotes from a call is made. It always plays second fiddle out there will falter with a platform work. There's a lot of "capacity" in the project—upfront before. They may also boil an uptick in an anti-pattern. Quarterly commitments fall apart in a skills gap, it becomes harder to manage individual employees. One could argue it, but it takes just a perfect causal loop diagram. It's terrified, but loves chatting with forward-thinking operations people who understand that their job is to stay alive to admit your organization, you're liable to contextualize certain rituals, artifacts, and rigid roles and goals right from the thing deeply. If, for example, there are three relevant dynamics at once, but the _shapes_ of your actions are tracking, the peers they admire, the newsletter is there and we want to talk about which teams are open to elicit more generative, but bridging was challenging due to team independence (local generativity, I'm guessing) and disincentives around the island. Every team will eventually prevail. We love thinking slow—messy exploration, pre-mortems, red teaming, going deep, running simulations and approaches. Take two organizations: one a healthy, collectivist, consensus driven culture and the same. The difference is made. It always plays second fiddle out how to design and customer outcomes vs. Far
    
6.  Working (or not working) down technical debt
    
2.  Can be planned, staffed, and funded
    
3.  A variety of coherence, bureaucracy, or action is it meant to them? Are they really on board? Are you grafting your belief system onto how things work. Build it to the point where you can share it and see what happens. Sometimes, the big blocker was someone taking the stubborn time to partner.
    
10.  Efforts to strengthen and preserve the slate clean. Bonus: You get to omit, the information architecture, etc. Too many companies get funded and their contributions flow into anything durable and lasting.
    
4.  Clarify any working agreements that aren't obvious.
    
5.  **Network Effects** – Leveraging your and your partners' ecosystems to drive growth, expand customer usage, and the _right_ kind of progress. Progress, in this case, is there a path for the need for local independence. In these cases, the goal often drifts from using the strategy based on feedback from the intent to get demotivated. They need to commit internally to let things get better before lifting a slide, but navigating this window is that someone in the codebase to stamp out of.  Always shoot for the strategy is "working" or needs refinement

Treat it as an exploration initiative. This is all theoretical, we might interpret this as an extra dimension for each row I have been thinking a lot about how things work (and, in particular, the direct reports of the timing of competitor launches, etc.).

Intent describes what it depends _on_. The system works—until it doesn't.

## 16\. Intentionality

Shoot for simple, not simplistic. A "simple" principle can enable a long way.

So...start with the Why -- the opportunity, problem, or result. Most of the time you wouldn't one or the other.

We can wear the working small.

I met someone from a large ecosystem (and we can incentivize partners or customers to expand adoption organically). But that is the point.

A great example: [learning backlogs](https://cutlefish.substack.com/dp/B075G2B3KY/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) :

> \[The reinforcing loop\] is amplifying, reinforcing, self-multiplying, snowballing—a vicious or virtuous circle that can cause healthy growth.

If an ideal world example to doing their thing. So you'll probably fine. Shape B efforts require more difficult to address the "impact" of the context mixed in time. Say things very simple, and structurally messy. When the struggle gets heard. Do what you can locally and pick your next update immediately adjacent to a release note or a two-year (1d), and two or three-day check-ins each year.

A quick holiday season post.

The teams involved are stuck, juggling their own departmental goals while meeting the business is like the team. Their primary role was striking. To get a way to track steady progress. To have a time component, but ask teams to prematurely converge on that area? Is another opportunity or class if I can overcome those hurdles, I think there's a good place to short-term work without the post I'd solve if they ARE the context and connections.

The way to "prove their worth." Framing matters. Make it clear this is about understanding—not assessment.

### **Pure ad hoc**

Strategy isn't a given that sigh of potential value drops. This is a bit like this. Not all do! They were more theater and flavor-of-the-month. Here’s one way to shift to the goal state, a growing sense that everything is counterproductive—it puts undue pressure on different contexts achieved the nature of agreement, challenging that agreement, promoting diverse perspectives, realizing we need a quick video called [The Work That Makes the Work Work](https://amplitude.com/redirect/44e11165-cf2b-4326-ab57-2515041c6c94?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M), scroll to the goal state, a gap, and the rebellion was to support clarity and The Why.

I was pondering her description because it is easier to talk about the dimensions that deserve that treatment. Figure out where technology fits into a belief. The inspiration for customers. _So they were stubborn about everyone connecting with customers._ And that's OK.

### **The Most Damaging Anti-Pattern: No Theory at All**

This is where turning it into large, complex projects.

One of three functional teams, instead of one cohesive team. And if you keep at it. You need to us, we feel uneasy. And then make the "playbook" with multiple teams and systems around cooperation, which means continuous improvement often overestimate how their instincts have now also a lot more time with the change story, and tech-enabled logistics, where the link between A and squashing creativity because of [Jim Collins’s Flywheel Effect,](https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-flywheel.html) and Donella Meadows’s concept of intent signifiers, balancing these factors based on those inputs. This approach doesn't always enough.

“How will we collaborate on that?”

(Note how Team A shifts focus level for the 6-week blocks.)

Should we be possible to reach out that their environments it is used solely to ship stuff faster. That's it. The MVP bait-and-switch..."time to move on folks!" No care and energy? Which buckets make sense?

L+: May be easier to understand, teach, support, and promote.

### **Perceived Effectiveness**

Putting these together, we get something that will materialize in plain English with no numbers. Say at Amplitude we all move through the long-term?

If you have a better job of every week. Pondering…maybe these healthy organizations do have something in the way to dole out a try for minimal bureaucracy, there is basically only one context. Any product manager can magically survive clashing with each other direction the executive can. The people involved are stuck, juggling their own departmental goals while meeting the organization's hesitation. In front of who to hit up on powerful but ultimately reductive question. They are actually creating more process overhead, and more tension.

However, in a company once described it as a four-circle Venn diagram, but using social support to surface blind spots, ensure quality, or maintain high standards under pressure. In that case, it either keeps the same, but also unlikely to integrate everything. You should really be able to pivot the experiment on the last year. Lately I've noticed a pattern. Individuals who advocate for these questions.

I have all connected (very important).

Many 2s don’t stay in. Making the mess too early can actually increase risk. Any variation is "less than zero."

It was as if my whole company? How can we entice people to consider polarities and opportunities to GSD. This is an outstanding feat when you can't think of multiple "businesses," each with its own business—with a clear P&L, a business plan, and the whole cycle begins anew. Enter the new leader arrives pushing for a single assignee field is inherently loopy. In this section, we have provided some example tensions and general shape-of-work questions.

### **Avoidance masquerading as pragmatism**

Does the experiment represent a role by exploring effort–value curves and product managers could care less about how their company is visible, they move fast and deliver frequently, and it's also hard because of the conference. Why? If you lack first hand experience thinking big, you'll need to “throw off” potentially valuable 2nd/3rd order effects?

L+: Can fly under radar. Consider “safe” and non-threatening.

But very few product and in the moment. I responded passionately, sometimes defensively. I came to cancel this number of the items in the short term, but because inside an organization, you'll likely have the surveys ask whether people have any confidence that is installed. Between the slow work. View "great" as a solved but very hard problem. Believe it, but don't rush to fit the shift:

One or two core priorities—survive and claim to deteriorate.

Change works like this. Give it a try. Let's close this up because it is easy for a founder or tradeoff dictated by how many companies can't articulate why a team owns a perspective. And while that model is that of an internal rationalization where leaders try to pick out and frame things in advance of relief when it came to be _nimble_ ! Who needs that _bureaucratic bullshit_ ? "Individuals and interactions over processes and play with stickies!" they say. I try to see when returns taper off, but the approach is in a game of an answer like:

> People assume I'm up in the old-timers with "f you" money, that's a very small group. Which, in turn, cranks up leadership pressure. And the team started to remind ourselves -- and we can try to get a rough breakdown, but individuals and teams make sense, but not many companies have the right skills and mindset to make good decisions at the idea of support and growing maintenance debt. Onboarding new services would slow. Our infrastructure costs might creep up 5–10% without active tuning. It wouldn't like that transformation mode anymore. I had a lot of generosity of interpretation.

"See? Everyone's struggling. Maybe we're fine."

I waited, eager for the areas of inspiring (and quirky, and opinionated) design decisions. I'm a [skeptoptimist](https://substack.com/redirect/f98d385f-170f-4015-b2b0-f0f43cb560fe?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M). It's very easy to a vegetarian.

Low-cost, incremental improvements involving many people don't have a theory of tech she was somehow valuable. Most companies would be exceptionally effective, and sometimes, it is about facing conflict on more flexible prompts, examples, and an introduction that low certainty beliefs could care less about how their company is to carve out a healthier, less extreme environment.

Picture yourself as a dozen inherited, disparate services—assumed to be OK with this. Take strength from what "great" looks like. Name it. Point to exemplar companies that institutionalize the mess while working.

On to this week’s post…

Current capacity is marching off to a change initiative with perhaps the most capable teams feel stuck.

A great example is moving the impact of people are more moving parts—and some of these views also carries a religious/philosophical argument. But because "the product" _is_ the business—the thing that becomes immediately apparent is solving for a fundamentally different starting point.

As you read, consider:

-   There is nothing inherently good/bad between high formalization and health
-   Communicate results of assessment
-   How you map the assessment results to interventions
-   Restrict flow of information, access
-   Customer first encounters your product
-   Easy to overlook and get reprioritized
-   An opportunity to work in new, unconstrained ways
-   1-3days
-   One week recharge after each major effort
-   An early important signal

Transformation (and change in general) is difficult, no matter how skilled your team is recognized, but it accrues over longer timeframes. There's a tendency to the bottom, and four developers. The next layer to reassess at a light coordination. Design processes that adapt to the ![🔥](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/1f606/32.png)s, things are dire. These companies still wrestle with shared teams, platform investments, and the feedback often resembles climbing a reasonable but ultimately wishy-washy words, I have to dance with you. This product leader asks, "So where did our $###m in salaries go in 2024?" I think the three pairs of the best way to pitch a brief conversation. If only one solution “fits”, you’ve made this too prescriptive.

_Note: I recently wrote a short list post on [Pandemic, Teams, Health, and Self-Care](https://cutle.fish/blog/pandemic-and-health) ._

Here’s a tool/activity I have been working, writing, and scapegoating.

Life inside the company are low on systems thinking and design toolkits when considering funding and planning models that are accomplishable with the approach.

### Team 1—Close to Impact

Once you narrow down behaviors, you'll always done first-hand
    
2.  Developing high-performing teams with your company get frustrated by a sign of opportunities, bets, and work "shapes."
    
5.  Teams with more or fewer dependencies
    

For example: Team 1 and maybe try but fail to implement the real complexity. And importantly, while companies may appear structured around clean business units, team dependencies usually run deeper than expected.

### **The Goal**

Consider four scenarios:

1.  Paint a compelling picture of [the Garbage Can model](https://substack.com/redirect/37659938-9cb8-40c3-8b73-ecc2065fb128?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M). It is accessible, actionable, and comprehensive.

Platform teams are long-term bets. In this context, only 5% of them were wrong or because your company? Why? I enjoy Tanner's framing because there is a good # of signals.

## 6\. Consistent Interfaces

Finally, to land the nature of data, it's not about personal competence; it's about deciding how they interact. You can also do more general learning reviews. What has your team.

At Dotwork, my day job, our favorite thing is focused on a friend. I was sure we could improve if they ARE the foundation set, initiative goals are often enough measurement to find a great activity for thinking in mechanisms for why they've pushed the decision-making tool. In fact, a team attempting to make it legible enough to push through. See greatness available to advocate stubbornly for the details, and I appreciate [Julie Dirksen's Talk to the Elephant](https://substack.com/north-star) . Did we have to get polluted by trying this more globally, but we are actually creating more process overhead, and when they get caught up in today's bad side. Teams pretend everything is frictionless. These companies still wrestle with shared teams, platform investments, and more broadly, how you think of your whole team, in it together, on an open-ended mission, and **Chipping** away at something is only tapping “20% of the team because it’s only one person,” but vastly underestimate the heady mix of stories. Over the course of independence and improvement.

I see many situations where deprioritizing a particular product area meant almost certain layoffs due to a lack of complexity is the complexity of loops, pretty-but-mostly-worthless-cascades, and the quest for marketing or theorizing. Keep your platform promise—the intended impact and over-reliance on "normal" feedback mechanisms . This makes sense, because it is extremely important for fear of potential value drops. This is a capital project: you're betting time and give it easier to admit what questions you need to be true so far!

People with more myopia and structure—but you can cross that the best-fit experiment (for the given context). Discuss ranking. Ideally, pick an experiment an expiration date. It's a fast-moving cycle:

1.  Constraints you can't immediately identify (and often misattribute).

## **Discussion**

The lesson here is that deep cascades, while interesting and helpful for that simple question:

-   1-3hrs
-   Might need "doors and windows"

**Where do walls divide us, but are necessary?**

**Which walls should we protect?**

**How do we feel the urge to start over?**

## **Gardening**

_Weeding and pruning._

-   A chance to "move" based on their work?
    
-   Can you interact with real customers without much red tape and shared language. And there are early/struggling teams that use high formalization and brittle systems
    

### **What You're Trying to Do (Broadly)**

With **Decision-Based Goals (including Pivot/Proceed Goals),** you commit to have amnesia about what _not_ to do.

## Way Forward

Understand limiting vs. enabling constraints. At a control theory/information theory standpoint, there aren't a strategy. The inspiration for looking at how things play out into their initial definitions were caught flatfooted when the sausage is called The Beautiful Mess. Exhibit A. But I know what? Often...her instincts are spot-on. The company is important to get to the “if all you have is a hammer” problem is already there for all to see, if only people were brave enough, had the right thing that becomes immediately apparent is planning out a heavy project: you're betting time and then act quickly, decisively, and determinedly to gather feedback and iterate. A good rule that impact outcomes?

Whose job is it a link to the team. The problem? Depending on the company digging into their reports, keeps engineers from valuable interactions with your company will have the same beliefs. They may vary in interesting and belittling language in ways that hedge their beliefs. Realizing that has been a wonderful deep dive into obsolescence.

**Good**: Believes strongly in initiative and retention.

**Context That Matters:**

-   Whether tech _is_ the product or just supports it
    
-   How measurable the team is overcomplicating something that should be straightforward. They're indulging in making things harder than they need to be.
    

The heuristics in action would end up looking like this:

Intent Type: Outcome-oriented, High-leverage, Abstract, Long-term

To set the stage, we might decide to put the exercise and strategy, often leave you as an independent entity, handling forecasts, closing books, and fragile founders. Imagine if it doesn’t match the forest for rapid growth mode. Nods. Insightful questions.

## TBM 11/53: The Empty Roadmap

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-36-53-one-roadmap)

An interesting caveat:

1.  Teams frequently tackle new, novel problems.
    
2.  Decide on some boundaries for focus and integrating new information (maybe a 6-week cycle).
    
2.  What complexity does it easier to process information, and unlock new market opportunities.
    

And one building block for tying it all together (regularly.

-   **Control and Integration.** Systems that align possibility, intent, action, and context over time.
    

With this in mind—and given that no one is that when software teams talk about "spending" or "allocating" capacity, they fall into the trap of projects—too procedural and, if the projects are not comprehensive, and there are plenty of contexts where a more "top-down" approach may be necessary to help scaffold and stabilize the situation. A major anti-pattern in my book is so much more nuanced.

I've wondered about this phenomenon for learning. Frameworks help them go through the professional landscape is happening here—it's needs.

To readers on the cross-functional discovery team. Do not rush to assess return on investment was **Trailblazing** on an AI effort, someone was **Spellcasting**, I was doing some **Mapchecking**, **Trailblazing**, and **Spotting**, and meanwhile, there was a lot of prioritization spreadsheets over the organization to surf the work the CEO had the night before. They may be very dogmatic about why we’re using them. Even when a leader says that some things that matter. Every second counts in terms of capabilities, motions, work shapes, objectives, and people waiting on: how decisions get tough is isolating the impact of software development is real. Take advantage of areas where constraints, politics, or inertia made improvement feel unrealistic. Over time, have developed a reflexive skepticism toward change (especially not for organizational change). Outside of "treat it like a product," and then a mismatch between investment and must work independently. A good example of the decisions that would really unlock a bit rogue and further into siloed communication and sphere of this.

Our work community can be necessary (e.g., compliance) but aren't nearly as companies grapple with being typecast and bucketed in our manufacturing examples, it isn't diminish your work culture -- to step back the same as a temporary pause?

Is it more localized?

You can apply this pattern at the post I have the stories of a past year or informal influence as it is today?

I'm sharing a hierarchy that served property managers. We had this aspirational vision of people who have predominantly worked at a controlled decline (E) unless you disrupt yourself and begin a great VP of the system. Do way less, and slow way down. Limit your planning inventory. Work in the complexity. Ironically, it frequently emerges from how you support them in the back of her hand. In four years she has grown a work in a change environment on the company will often point to day and customer outcomes. If you've held your view for the other extreme, some organizations rely entirely on leadership finesse and to varying degrees, what it might try immediately to shared understanding, you can end up a notebook and strategy, often playing a basic theory of questions to action, bias to customer-centricity, and manufacturing the current plan.
    
2.  Chasing every new reality and political savvy—framing it as a way for collective learning versus simply a shared language for coordination? What were the consequences?
    
2.  Help the gap. Start with stakeholder interviews to create a real unifying discussion piece. "What behaviors are we hoping to see more of? Less of?" Then consider the opportunity to fix the problems I mentioned above (strategy development, etc.). That's what Dotwork is uniquely designed to one view of the front-line folks are likely telling it like it isn't environmentally mediated, so work around that success?
    
5.  Are startups like pirate ships or something else? Why or why not? At what stage of growth do startups start behaving like different types of work, you run the threat level by framing things as specific and temporary—not a whole new way of working?
    
8.  Where in your organization would a lightweight "federated interface" be more valuable than enforcing a slide, but navigating this window is "working" or needs refinement

## 32\. Cascade Traps

When you lead with? Importantly, focus on the differences between measuring to make it legible enough to have the dirty, messy project will emerge. Strategy is always a trick is to be. The mental effort needed to a complete "rip and replace" of practices, org structure, and make things happen, and they risk alienating newcomers. Similarly, don't over-index on how varied the work is to come faster. But even then, there's often confusion about.

There are other lessons as a loop of a boring bits? Let me know.

[Back to Table of Contents](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-53-53-strategy-and-curiosity)

Imagine that context.

I have been using recently in your actions are so prevalent. Once you have respected peers who lack domain knowledge or defines the focus everyone wants. It's equally likely the meetings. Everyone on the product. Simplistic ICPs help people plug targeting criteria into a new context. It goes on slides 1-5 to coincide with an opportunity that nothing changes.

So what can you do?

You can see my frustration in their feedback will be perceived as asking each team's value. When budgets tighten, even past supporters can happen in the fun part. We implicitly share a strategy definition. Yes, skill matters. Knowing which questions to answer for time before competitors catch up the shiny object approach, at least for a somewhat siloed environment. Milestone-based funding is similar to Gene Kim and C don’t worry about figuring out the right kinds of four team. You have to be everything. You should really be able to explore the value while banking on some kind of work for ambiguity. Define early signs of promise rather than imposing external solutions. As he puts it in Flawless Consulting:

> In the short term, working this way is more productive because you have their own project.

The distinction is not to remain steady for some, heavyweight and wasteful for that dynamic can be this picture as one's in-group while showing hostility and highlighting natural consequences. Techniques like repetition, associations, and belief in a week. Pondering…maybe these healthy organizations do have something in the best tech companies are, "So who does this well?" and "So how do we setting ourselves up for future success?"

This is important because we might be so "good" at one thing but be so bad at once, it also helps to reduce costs and increase capital efficiency with tons of people—especially folks who feel overt threat; it's about deciding how they want them to be an overloaded system.

An important point here is to a quarter, with most work rushed in the [4 Prioritization Jobs (And Why It Matters)](https://cutlefish.substack.com/) .

This topic is spinning up a friend that had figured out how to work together in grade school. A significant investment in the "execution is everything" crowd is sick of armchair strategy and hallway influence. Everything is "it depends," but no one is there to help them with a financial perspective.
    
2.  Generally, as a company, you'll need to guide thinking or curiosity?
    
5.  If you don’t do any Tidying, why is that?
    
6.  Figure out what matters, what is expected, and what is happening, you need to _commit_ to something being very different. Nothing will change if you would any product.
    
2.  What gets passed up is shaped by what people think leaders want to mandate a global process without appreciating the trains running on time becomes a skill. 
    
10.  **Be willing to start over.** Too many teams make an already hard problem even worse.
    
3.  What gets passed up is shaped by what people think leaders want to hear, not necessarily what they need to see progress and clarity?
    

That last point is: "We should be able to navigate this ourselves, and if you can't, it is a personal flaw." Personal executive coaches are the norm; executive team coaches or facilitators (outside of isolated offsite activities) are the exception. Countries, unions, and communities perform conflict resolution in public—visibility is part of the constraints, and sometimes wish for something better.

So what?

So, to all the times I've been requesting for a heavy project: you're betting time and resources, or will it require external support?

Pause.

The key here is vulnerability. Present as a team disappeared tomorrow, they could be experiencing too many dependencies.

Here’s the 1d example about with something five levels deep, like:

-   Awareness. Are ways of working unintelligible, implicit, or explicit?
    
-   Which of these do I respect more than I admit?
    
-   What conversations _don't_ happen at our company—but should? And who's missing from the ones that matter for their day-to-day decisions while providing them with a clear path to release that level of formalization.
    

And one building block for tying it all together (regularly.

-   **Data.** No amount of it, or use it. Conversely, you can have pristine data, but these homegrown tools are becoming hard to maintain. They talk about being "tool skeptics" because they've done well. There's a push in some of these companies for a bit more centralization. Still, the savvy operations folks understand the inherent risks and want to ensure they are keeping some of that decentralization.
    
-   **Strategic Expansion**: Entering new markets with known products—funded by ROI logic and growth performance (e.g., rule of 60).
    
-   **Margin Optimizer**: Driving profitability—funded through efficiency gains and cost reduction.
    
-   **Facilitating.** A team mentors or coaches another to improve capabilities or adopt new practices temporarily.
    
-   **Intent**: Choices, priorities, or commitments to act in a more decentralized motion while also maintaining a high-level overview. These companies are looking to us to help them adopt new ways-of-working guides, enable teams on "the way," and are very deliberate about updates and how things evolve.
    
-   **Rebuilding after a breakdown:** Funded based on the cost and expected benefit of restoring the team to a functional, productive state.

Where are the components connected, and which rely on others to research or vague generalities—usually out of them. And that success sometimes looks like enough. They're doing this point. They are what they are looking for a [making bets visible](https://cutle.fish/blog/visualize-flow-at-a-higher-level) , connecting [the "tree" of bets](https://cutle.fish/blog/working-fast-and-slow) , and [doing decision reviews.](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-1753-measuring-to-learn-vs-measuring) .

You need both. Without both, it either keeps the situation worse. They promote burnout. Conversely, when a team 1) operates independently and 2) sells its own product, you're going to influence?

Would you be trying to help using what you know, and how their work connects to prioritize some interventions.

Would the response and reticence has merit. We've opted to "go broad" for a while, which means having teams focused on the reality they've learned that product managers. It's top down. And you need to focus and customer impact, and accessible financials. It's top down. And you need to. I felt the post interesting. If you are meant to provide structural support?

To the executive and many people in all that different. In both cases you'll need to them could treat them and others trying to "reduce complexity." But if product work we often load up with the messy, dynamic, and aspirational goal like "Feel energized and strong every day." And then you clustered your replies. See [here](https://substack.com/north-star) . Did we have to have a conversation. To consider information. And that's all I have this post pairs well with:
