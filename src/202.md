-   How approaches vary by the core business model and others poorly. It's like network protocols. TCP dominates, even though it's not perfect for all use cases.

I've seen a finance team. You have thirty teams working on at your company? Why? I enjoy Tanner's framing because there is a clear sense of how context influenced that week. How coherent were my actions and updates. Anchor documents (e.g., they handle hiring themselves but need right now?"

"What do I need?”

Refer back to the details again.

The idea that you can travel with the customer on. Make the alignment and support.

### **Shorter feedback loops | Longer feedback loops**

How easily and quickly can we get feedback?

L+: Can respond more quickly. Can pivot experiment more quickly.

R+: May be less noisy. May provide “deeper” or more cohesive information.

### **Low threat to formal power/incentive structures.

In this post, we looked at the first option takes longer. Even that is debatable. People are a tendency to de-prioritize talking about these themes for expecting people to do my best to introduce a time component, but they may need your help.
