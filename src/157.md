# Full Stack Deployment Guide
## Deploy Arc AI Agents with Complete Functionality

✅ Payment request created:
   - Agent performance metrics
   - Streamlit UI for streaming compilation (200-400ms vs 400-800ms)
   - Test data documentation
   - Currency: USDC
   - Creates GitHub release

### Performance
- [x] Tool execution works
- [x] State schema validated
- [Bank Pro Invoice Adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rytass/storages-adapter-r2): Cloudflare R2 storage with multi-payment method support
- [x] Can handle 1000+ intents/sec
- [x] Market agent tools work
- [ ] Authentication required on all sensitive queries/mutations
- [ ] Move feeds.rst → features/frontend.rst

#### ✅ Risk Agent
- Store secrets in sidebar

### Syncing Versions Across Repos

This is the **Inkeep Agent Framework** - a multi-agent AI system for intelligent intent coordination has been successfully built and integrated!

## Step 5: Service Discovery Options

### 1. **Differentiation (Can't be easily copied)**

**Objectives**:
- IntentRegistered
- ✅ ESP32-C3 machine type support with other agents instead of relying on something else
- Use the existing Swift style: 4-space indentation, same-line braces, `UpperCamelCase` for types, `lowerCamelCase` for functions/properties, and descriptive enum/raw value names.
- Test providers in sidebar

#### Function Execution Limits

| Service | Constraint | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Workers | 30s CPU (paid), 10ms (free) | Use streaming for long operations |
| R2 object size | 5TB max |

**Environment-Specific Deployment:**

```typescript
"How Are You": "你好吗",
"Something went wrong": "出现了问题", 
"New payment amount x from y": "收到付款 :x 来自 :y",
"Something went wrong": "出现了问题",
"New payment amount x from y": "收到付款 :x 来自 :y",

// ❌ WRONG - Title case or snake_case
"Transaction transfer credit out": "转帐至 :to_username",  // zh.json

"Merchant Transaction settlement canceled": "结算取消（:merchant_order_id）",  // zh.json
"How are you": "你好吗",           // Wrong: Title case
"How are you": "你好吗",           // Wrong: Title case
"How Are You": "你好吗",           // Wrong: Title case
"durable_objects": {
  "bindings": [{ "name": "MY_DO", "class_name": "MyDurableObject" }]
},
"migrations": [{ "tag": "v1", "new_classes": ["MyDurableObject"] }]
```

**Queues:**
```javascript
// ❌ CONFLICT PRONE: Many concurrent calls updating same counter
6. **Full E2E**: Intent submission needs event log extraction fix
pip install x402-a2a web3 eth-account
```
