# CLAUDE.md

This guide covers 12 automation workflows ranked by implementation difficulty and will be extended with additional features such as:
- Discover optimal matches between intents
- API health status
- Use relative paths: `[link text](https://example.com)`

## Search and Discovery

class X402PaymentService:
    """
    Process settlement with payment requirement
    """

    # Step 1: Calculate service fee

- Transaction hash
- Settles transactions on-chain
- Sybil attack prevention
- On-prem servers (Linux x86_64 or ARM64)
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Small mistakes are okay - UI will eventually show correct values
