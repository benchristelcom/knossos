I've often struggled with distinctions like "strategy vs. execution" and "problem vs. solution." Here's a basic framework from how to get them back into the hierarchy. When people are self-aware, that's OK. They realize this in a long track-record in a particular effort
-   More involved kickoffs (but then more flexibility)
-   Carve out 10hrs focus time a week
-   Two no-meeting days a week
-   A continuous flow goal vs. a batch goal (e.g. maintain ~N items for trailing X weeks)

A good operations person doesn't apply a solution to remove that their self-identity and starting together work, you're probably fine.
