# The Website of Elias Tusques

Hey! I'm Elias, Principal Engineer at CashNow Vehicle 5 LLC, a Delaware
corporation. We are the world's first investment banking platform for dogs,
with over 3 million account holders. We also issue the first ever credit card
for dogs.

Your first thought is probably "is this for real?" and I assure you it totally
is. It turns out finance is almost entirely unregulated if you know what you're
doing.

The way it works is, we detect potential customers via security camera video
(we partner with a third party that obtains publicly accessible Ring camera
footage) and use AI to detect their intent to open an account. Then we run a
credit report (also AI) and issue them a card.

Incidentally, I am also the CTO and cofounder of Nowhere.ci, which makes
personalized dietary supplement systems for dogs. Nowhere.ci partners with
CashNow Vehicle 5 LLC to detect intent to purchase via video feed data. We then
charge the card and ship the product to the address associated with the
security camera.

We have over $145M in accounts receivable with insane gross margins, and we are
looking to expand into new product lines. The rates on the cards are good too —
around 12%. We are going to be raising a Series C round in the next 3 months or
so. If you are interested in investing, watch this space.
