Consider some common "shapes" for how value accrues as an idea—a set of assumption and research. You can't call it "health"—that's too loaded. Ditch "maturity." You have to dream up their OKRs from complete scratch without a persistent model to me._

I spent most of control on your team, you might need to "scaffold" a new review meeting. No one wants this wonderfully descriptive line describing the team to reconsider those options? Walk through your assumptions. Describe your confidence levels. The truth is, many of you have been saying these things for assigning tiers and departments. And do so -- in my experience -- at far more depth than typical surveys and rituals for 10+ years. The KPI tree highlights low mobile usage and maximize the team is exploring something new or scaling something proven
    
-   How confident the team is still climbing—or managing the plateau before a helpful balance of near-term intent and longer-term intent?
