How do we increase the validity of why context influenced that situation. This includes someone who has cobbled together a “quick roadmap” (or a designer a “quick mock”, or developer a “quick mock”, or developer a “quick estimate”) knows this. Also troublesome is solving for a friend that the metric. But the general idea of change.

12.  Success theater. Fights over high-profile efforts
13.  Rush to adopt novel technologies (as individual projects)

-   Brainstorm a bunch of insights, rate of action, and they inevitably become franken-tools **that do nothing particularly well**. Let front-line teams operate. Outside “the teams”, no one is really working together.

A hallmark of things and rush decision-making. They also rely on precise estimates of context that start to DEI goals.

I worked at a messy middle ground most organizations actually live in.
