### Back-Pressure: Review Budgets with Live Workloads

### Step 4: Review Results
- Arc SDK - Blockchain interaction

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **DOCKER-ONLY** QEMU testing. Do NOT attempt to use local/native QEMU installations. All QEMU testing must run inside Docker containers for governable self-improvement.

**Agent-side circuit breaker**: If pending proposal count exceeds 50, agents only report critical findings. Above 25, only critical + warning. Below 25, all findings.

**What doesn't need an LLM at all (~60-70% of analysis):**

-   Naming convention violations (regex against governance prefix rules)
-   Auto-execution of any kind (all proposals are review-only)
-   Stale tables (last\_modified threshold arithmetic)
-   Orphaned policies (set difference)
-   Overprivileged sharing (policy joins with access patterns)

**Hono (@hono/clerk-auth):**
```typescript
2. Document any architectural decisions or important findings
