# BERDL Data Lake Stewardship System — Multi-agent design with human-in-the-loop curation

_Multi-agent data stewardship with human-in-the-loop curation for a governed multi-tenant scientific data lake._

## Problem Statement

[](https://gist.github.com/dauglyon/d81a96b812b3298f8d862005387b9a0c#buy-vs-build-hybrid-with-openmetadata)

### idtag System
- No filesystem access; work with buffers in memory
- Datadog for async operations
- Each class has `.from_idtag(tag)` auto-detects type from first character

### Known Limitations
- Payment completed message
- https://192.168.2.6:8006;pve;external;internetbox
```

## Architecture Overview

### VS Code

3. **Prompt Building Updated**:
   - Ensure running: `ollama serve`
   - Passes single `flash-image: qemu-build/merged.bin`
   - Main file path: `ui/streamlit_app.py`

Authentication uses tokens from the externalEntities array when loading.

## Troubleshooting

### 4. Production Ready
- Full-text search with AI enhancement

### **Phase 2: Core Agents (Week 3-4)**

**Traditional System**: Same performance always
**Manual cost:** $1,600/month (8 hrs/week)  
**Automated cost:** $100/month  
**Annual savings:** $18,120  
**Difficulty:** Medium  

What it does: Triggers welcome sequences based on plan type, sends recap to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with documentation:

1. **Persistent state** - Work survives agent restarts
Inspect project files to task input keys, assign I/O types
20. podcast.rst - Merge with transcript.rst
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Scenario 3: Accidental Deletion**

```bash
google-auth-httplib2>=0.1.0
