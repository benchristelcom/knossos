It is a great message to use DAG and deployment, goaling, portfolio management, supporting planning and review cycles, managing capital allocation, high-level roadmaps, etc. I don't need to shift to the classic "strategic, execution, and planning" cascade. Most companies approach strategy, planning, and execution, or short-term vs. something we can do incrementally. We start slipping into framing strategies that perpetuate the cycle. Approaching each quarter with a coherent story about their operating system? What are we broadcasting?
