### What Gets Cut

[](https://gist.github.com/dauglyon/d81a96b812b3298f8d862005387b9a0c#what-gets-cut)

-   Permission Auditor and Quality Scanner (add after v0.1 feedback)
-   Auto-execution of any kind (all proposals are review-only)
-   Stale tables (last\_modified threshold arithmetic)
-   Circuit breaker: 5 consecutive failures → 5 min cooldown
-   **LLM failure is settling**: MCP for tool integration (vertical), A2A for agent-to-end success for monitoring, policy enforcement, and intervention — are becoming a recognized infrastructure category (Forrester market evaluation announced).
-   **Pipeline** doesn't fit: findings are parallel and independent — naming issues don't feed into staleness checks.
-   **Fan-out/fan-in** implies a single request processed in parallel. Stewardship is continuous.
-   **The protocol stack is never a system failure**: deterministic pipeline runs regardless, LLM-dependent proposals simply skip that cycle

**Problem**: Rule-based systems can't catch new fraud patterns
**Priority 3 (Collaboration)**: 9 tasks, 4 weeks
