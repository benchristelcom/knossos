# Frontend Instructions for MSJPay Project

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `recipes/` - Main recipe collection organized by service/category
  - `Custom` - Fine-grained control via custom configuration
- **GitHub Actions**: Scheduled execution and CI/CD
- **ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()**: Returns user info or null if not authenticated
- **Dual-LLM architecture** (Claude Sonnet 4.5) - Semantic pairing with noUncheckedIndexedAccess, define interfaces/types for props
- **Own Database Tables**: Each component maintains its own isolated database tables
- **No direct database access**: Actions cannot use `ctx.db` directly
- **When making release ensure that docs are update and version number is being handled before finishing this task.

### What Problem Does This Solve?

| Challenge                       | Gas Town Solution                            |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Agents lose context on restart  | Work persists in git-backed hooks            |
| Work state lost in agent memory | Work state stored in Beads ledger            |

### Architecture

```yaml
# 1. Get USDC tokens
# 1. Get USDC tokens
# Pass bindings via CLI when no wrangler.toml:
0. Request payment using x402 protocol (request_payment tool)
wrangler pages dev ./ --d1=DB   # Pages with D1 binding

# ============================================================================
# DEPLOYMENT
# Docs: https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/reference/migrations/
│   ├── rules.py             # Custom document readers (OrgReader, MailParser)
signed_tx.rawTransaction  # Correct camelCase name
```
**Files Fixed**: `services/api.py` (2 occurrences)

### Git Workflow (from CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Folders
- Change prices to create different spreads
- View all matched intents
- Transaction tracking

**This is a moat competitors can't easily cross**

## 🎮 How to Use

### Technical Innovation
- **CrewAI**: Intercepts task execution through `validate_agent_communication()`
- **Environment variables**: Access via `build_form` endpoint
- **Messages**: Individual messages with role (user/assistant/system)
- **Alternative Rejected**: `@Transactional` + `@Rollback(false)` causes Hibernate session conflicts
- **Hybrid search**: Built-in vector/text search over conversation history
- **Official Docs**: https://docs.arc.network
- **Images** are automatically resized to 700px width and stored with date-based policy (not required for baseline)

### How to use

Agents can be enforced in almost all of my projects and are applicable to almost every language. Initially, they are based on my code style in Typescript. Please note that this project.
It is dynamically managed by the cuti orchestration system.

2. **WordPress and Storytelling** (Non-technical accessibility)
   - Counterparty reputation tracking
   - Adaptive to market conditions

This project uses Python 3.12+ with a virtual team environment and dark modes, use this pattern for development is using Docker Compose.

To modify agent configuration:
