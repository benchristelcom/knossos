# Arc Agentic AI System - Verification Report

**For presentation slides**:
- Tells LLM to request payment FIRST
- Real gas costs and network latency
- ✅ State management validation
- Hunting patterns: `config/hunting_patterns.json` - Threat detection rules
- Cache directory: `~/.cache/rag-client/`
- Organized by service type (Grafana, Prometheus, UniFi, etc.)
- Theme configuration
- ✅ LLM integration via `FRONTEND_URL` when testing new environments.

Guidance for which semver level to enable cryptocurrency payments for High Performance Computing (HPC) on AWS. Each recipe includes CloudFormation templates, documentation, and timing.

### Future Directions

Utilities for agents live under `tools/`:

- **knowledge_tool.py** – manage Knowledges.
- **Compositional Verification**: Verifying skill chains requires richer formal specifications.

### 5. Avoid "Busywork Updates"
- Moat: Proprietary AI + data network effects

## CRITICAL: Documentation Verification Rules

### Technical Metrics
- Filter by active/matched status
- Complex reporting and escrow funding
- Basic Analytics Dashboard

### Environment Variables

**What's Ready**:
- Agents monitor system 24/7
- Streaming import via Fivetran not currently supported
- Inherit from `NonIsolatedEnv` or `IsolatedEnv` in `rlm/clients/base_env.py` (520 lines)
- Address 69: `Present_Position` (current position, read-only)
- When `Lock=0`: Motor is in free-wheel mode OR EPROM is writable
- Cost: ~$5/day
- Merchant verified signature matches payment flow automatically
- Updated `config/.env` with Arc testnet configuration
- ✅ Fallback logic working (bug fixed)
- Smart Prompts for AI-powered content interaction
- Icons and help text
- ✅ Fallback logic working
- README.rst: Project overview and development guide
- Load both backend and performance optimizations

### React (Vite) Hooks

**Status**: PASS

**Phase 2: Deep Analysis (Day 3-4)**
1. Run `python peek.py` to understand dataset structure
TODO.md                           ✅ Roadmap
2. Build and validate models (if applicable)
plt.rcParams['font.size'] = 14
```

**Convex Auth (alternative, beta):**

```typescript
✅ **Bug Fixes**: 4 critical bugs fixed
3. **Form Initialization** - To get dropdown options (countries, categories, etc.) for forms

### 3. **Step-by-Step Execution**

**Start with Phase 1: Pure Algorithmic**
- Write comprehensive unit tests using Plotly
- Keep dependencies updated
- Verification details and quantities

#### ✅ Fraud Agent
- Account information
- Balloons animation for different operations
- Each context has its own `ME.md` file for personal context

## Testing

- ✅ **Production-Ready**: 5,511 LOC, 27/27 smart contract tests passing
- Sybil attack prevention
- Transparent and auditable

### Prerequisites

- **Success Rate**: % of tasks solved correctly (exact-match verification)
- **Imports**: Use type imports (`import type { Foo } from './bar'`), organize imports enabled, barrel exports (`export * from './module'`)
- **Formatting**: Single quotes, semicolons required, 100 char line width, 2 space indent, ES5 trailing commas
- **Development workflow**: The `./watch.sh` script automatically regenerates the explorer link
- **ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()**: Returns user info or null if not authenticated
- **Threat Intel**: yara-python, pymisp, stix2, taxii2-client

## Development Iteration Workflow

### Phase 1: Content Migration (NO DELETION)

#### Getting Started Section
- [x] Dashboard displays metrics correctly
- [x] Throughput: 1000 intents/sec ✅
- [x] All public methods have docstrings
- [x] 4 matches inserted and queryable
- [x] Create streamfield.rst documenting REST API and Wagtail API
- [x] Created `test_agentic_system.py`
  - CoordinationState TypedDict
  - Build workspace invitation system (local file-based)
  - Graceful degradation - monitoring continues even if Discord fails
  - Available blocks (CodeBlock, ImageChooserBlock, etc.)
  - Creating custom blocks
  - maturity-level  # core, beta, community
archon:manage_task(
  key: string,
  findDuplicates,
  criteria: Array<keyof Tag> = ["artist", "title"],
): AsyncGenerator<string> {
  let lastError: Error;

  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      const path = join(directory, file);
      const targetTag = targetFile.tag();
      if (extensions.includes(ext)) {
        yield fullPath;
      }
    }
  }
}

async function processLargeLibraryStream(rootDir: string) {
  console.log(`- ${file.path}`);
}

// Find files without volume normalization
