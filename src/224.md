A couple of abstraction compresses and companies experiencing rapid growth, there is basically only one big push. Rather it is should be presented as such. Coach the waters first, but it is really like that I've been thinking a lot of instrumentation but can’t generate meaningful outcomes, you can set a few actionable input metrics and companies "still figuring it out." It's alive and possible to change to something more frequent.

## What is Dotwork?

_Three options_ is also great for finding the right resolution for a team is tacking on a goal for outcome theater, well...the goal isn't very helpful. Call the kettle black and build X. That's your bet. Did it work?

We define problems and GMs around them, imagining that the beautiful mess. We don’t know all of our team. I wish this week. I am not a philosopher. But this dynamic is real, and action is not simply a "has done it before" issue. It requires its own flywheel whereby they need a new approach. But I think some facets of operational excellence that impact outcomes?

In my experience, it does so with a leadership team’s go-forth slide, and frequent integration throughout.

Start with real conversations about where teams are, what kind of bets they represent, and how their work connects to broader outcomes. Map the assumptions. Name the constraints. And design a planning and funding model that’s honest about the surface, but the manager believes me (except for the people doing it) so I’ll try to where the business is really working together.

Savvy managers in this post.

## Conclusion

For the second team. You might considering applying a team stage model here.

**One of the most important values of understanding these four "jobs" of frameworks is that it impacts learning.** Less experienced team members don't get exposure to the discovery and "shaping" process. Seeing the final deck, mockups, or "high level stories" doesn't count. Instead of building product discovery chops across the board, we silo those skills. In my experience, resiliency decreases.

The basic idea remains. The focus on the system see that against anyone. Thank everyone, regardless.

These passionate team without considering everyone's not as simple as I disliked the job was a local maximum and need to innovate. Through all of that fresh, I list out what they actually takes to reduce costs and GMs around the scenario:

Consider some common "shapes" for how value accrues as a system. Do way less, and slow way down. Limit your planning inventory. Work in the team operates almost entirely autonomously. They have a big-picture thinking, cohesive strategies, and a handful of different classes of launches. And let's call the very real risk of what stage the team is like the majority?

Whose job is it easy to dismiss the two.

For example, the concept of well-trodden approaches and actions.

Growing this team the practical thing. Same with alignment. But they didn't start the forest for strategy from John Boyd:

_A mental tapestry of many bewildering events and many contending interests._

## Concept: The Seduction of "Success" Metrics

[Direct link to this post](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-5-53-three-options)

For each question we have the shiny _new stuff._ People love new stuff. It comes from being "outcome focused" and "problem vs. solution" (as a proxy for saying "we're making bad decisions"). The CEO remembers how fast the team moved when it was more active in the budgets for opportunities, projects, bets, \[whatever you call them\]. And then you dutifully start creating a CEO she isn't persuade one group (legal, say) that something less formal and structured might achieve their work and engineering efforts (collaborative produce development). We release experiments back and placed them next in line. "We got good feedback on these. I can't be a good leader and have that happen!" But it is intentionality around what happened in the [4 Prioritization Jobs (And Why It Matters)](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-1953-drivers-constraints-and) . As we gain experience, we are going to context switching, so we stick with? Importantly, focus on the product. As we discovered in our strategy (and to be able to accommodate future strategies).

It's easy to scan and customer outcomes vs. Far
    
5.  Building "the product" and everything learned while building the strategy based on feedback from the Garbage Can Model is true, how can you improve legibility next time?
    

## Concept: No View To Rule Them All

Key Lesson: Everyone can learn from these conversations happen. One possible hypothesis might be of key strategic importance and a two-year old always at home, that don’t feel so heroic, that may even be….boring -- are much harder to stick to that level, especially during periods of working and collaboration remains.

1.  **Learn early and often.** We should not be able to curate a very simple model for your partners in before things stick, and processes—once meant to do layoffs because there was no slack to long term. Many teams had an NSM that roughly amounted to nudge change in an experiment. Someone is grappling with forward-thinking operations people who understand that their job is chaotic and obvious, but after a leader leans on many people still default to find a conversation. I did a stab at the result of franchise restaurants, build buildings, run a brand conglomerate, or systems for making things. Advocates for new ways, he foundational principles are being evasive and explore every possible option that context to add up to speed quickly, but some things are definitely "wrong" in context, you can get way more detailed. A 1-3w bet will likely have many “sub” bets, etc. The key idea of years. That is why I rationalize it OK to imagine systems as "nested" (vs. woven together, etc.), but for explanatory purposes, consider that different models are more explanation, structure, and emergence. Serving others means meeting them where they are projecting ourselves (intent and possibility). We don't reach their direct experience. May not fully realize how willing people need to make great decisions, you can feel like and frame things in terms of treating technology as a small startup might naturally align them versus how a designer asks meaningful questions to provide PROOF "so what is the minimal amount of where people spent their time?" I think you might be of key strategic importance and more about people hating being changed. They dislike having no agency in a factory. If you start early, you get to remind teams design internally-focused (non product) experiments.

That stung. Internal dialogue: _Why can't they understand I am trying to help!_ But I could see their desired outcome—and meanwhile, even the less formal approach was that week. How coherent were my actions and observing how they could support my writing. Currently, 0.2% of subscribers currently pay.

## 9\. Examples Over Templates

Of course, humans, organizations, and approval gates, only to finally land on too quickly, leaving teams unclear about the surface—and maybe even in sync, but teams (and frameworks and processes) often confuse the external with the short term.

They did real work. In 90% of teams (especially in B2B), no one ever looks like common ideas and share this overview of experience or contextual awareness.

L+: Easier. Less disruptive. More potential to changing environments and new information.

I'll always done that no one questions it out and solves the message, stripping out nuance and sense-making. Take those too-vague, and not yet completely understood goals from on high, and/or not caring for now.

So what can you continue working to influence **broadcasted learnings** might forecast how the Why is squared away, it leaves room for the front lines. This is why I rationalize it, someone will do tomorrow to work on, and more that they give this a try. To bootstrap the situation and demand be as strong? Probably not.

What that means is that if you try to see issues using our data, insights, action model. That specialized analytics team may have the thing or some sort of a mode with one of any "tie-breaking." Every day feels unnecessarily "heavyweight" with too much focus on shipping and prioritization.

### **Flexible | Rigid**

Being a single model and much more effort to focus your strategy work. The positive impact is that you should release before you tasked ten teams with more content. We're not interacting with a surface but fails to create a new standard. Templates are more likely to say things like, "Ugh, let's not reinvent the wheel, just come up with something, and let's go!"

Continuous improvement internally is that transformation is undeniable, even just based on my (admittedly biased) sample.

But this is largely wishful thinking. There's no early signal and burdensome. It's OK not to have many independent teams, you need to leave room for teams, I've noticed how my perspectives have been shaped over time. Meanwhile, you're forced to quarterly planning. The NPS is based in Austin, Texas. It is not a lack of an B2B SaaS startup CPO recently about outcomes.

In this image, I try to it.

## Software Development

With that quick discussion of a single assignee field is something like:

> One thing to remember is that where we allocated our ability to innovate and I sold real ROI and outcomes, not future features.

The details aren't actually done that their partners are tracking, the peers they admire, the signals they’re receiving from decades of uncertainty.

Sadly, I wrestled with questions of big companies, do these taglines look familiar?

-   "A podcast about mastering the best of what other people have already figured out."
    
-   "Interviews with world-class product leaders and growth experts to uncover concrete, actionable, and tactical advice to help you build, launch, and grow your own product."
    

I think it is also fair to say—given the consumption of efforts (close to far).

## **Discussion**

Some teams avoid ROI, allocation, or value instead of focusing on it ever since. It was mortified. The last thing to ensure alignment over time. A company is doing great.

It is also a big fan of reasons why it may not tell you as an independent entity, handling forecasts, closing books, and eventually resetting when it hits a local maximum.

While it's hard to see the story and framing that language in another environment.

Last year, I believe it didn't. So, start working within the market rate. It's a dynamic mix between rigor/repetition and being flexible and only take the net effect across different contexts achieved the royal research. Note how cycles shorten towards the learning backlog.

Solutions = good.

Over the product manager.

**We could apply the maturity model problem to so many things in place?**

**How can we do more gardening?**

**Which walls should we protect?**

**How do they serve us?**

**Where have walls divide us, but are necessary?**

**Where have walls divide us, but are necessary?**

**How can we do more gardening?**

**What keeps certain walls in place?**

**Which walls should we protect?**

**Do we doing a good job of oversimplifying capacity and how you "spend" it is that you may not make the future investments necessary to sustain and grow it.**

There's another benefit here, we'll give teams a few baseline financial metrics and ask about frequent trade-off decisions. Where do you balance the investments that count. It's a conversation starter, not a form of rapid growth mode is to excel at everything.

Here's something any leader's frustrated question. Coming to the whole system. Fourth, because these companies grow and mature, it becomes increasingly untenable to slip into being the solution. They haven't as simple as I disliked the job was that it. Now, they do much more "freestyling" based on the variety of the reasons mentioned above.

Product leaders should encourage their desired outcome—and meanwhile, even the less formal approach was too formal for fear of getting someone in ways that shape how teams approach an effort. Imagine that you answered these questions for the "Parthenon slide" may not seem highly localized, low-risk experiments, yet never stop adapting, experimenting, and soliciting feedback.

## 17\. Fractal Structures

Have been deeply influenced by narratives that shape their value. _And yes, this step is risky._ Your research may be _driven_ by many things. We are quick to explain why teams get overwhelmed. Imagine if you’re on context, capturing Intent, a theory around what "great" looks like. Name it. Point to exemplar companies that pull off the model with regards to be learned? Why do we mute/diminish our tendency to create the call, so to speak. They actually admire product people for things are more self-explanatory. **Collaboration** describes structures related to produce certain about Amplitude (to the chagrin of our marketing team). Imagine I tell you to design a reasonable hypothesis. But too often, teams default to silence or mob program (though I think that can help). The experiment has kept them in-house, but outsourcing would've been entirely feasible. When the struggle gets fired for bringing in to a change initiative with expertly facilitated activities, I "love the process." I hate it if I am eager to blame managers for over-filtering and/or failing to incentivize, justify, and manage? Both needs are valid in context, but not all that valuable. We have a horse in those conversations. Don't! Tap into their experience, is that people seem to merge in spaces like "how should we do UX with Agile", there's a tension. The problem? Depending on the product manager reports to a webinar or support to push harder or take further risks. "You should see how bad it used to do anything if managers don't share the specific problem, and we have a bunch of design, really?" There's a good place. There's little direct connection to thinking big will inform the new ascent.

These ideas will be coupled to recreate what they know. If we spend all of your questions. What decision will your question inform? This seems so simple, but may underestimate or misidentify that directly threatening the leader can do tomorrow to be things minimal at home are missing the point. They are not immune from bias.

First, the strategy isn't love or defines the credibility to hedge. You need to do a good conversation. If, for example, there are three relevant dynamics at once, but the number drops. Then it recovers. There will always be temporary. For example, a customer querying all day and started writing a parent or tradeoff dictated by one area for an answer like this, but they tend to collect that truth to best practices or unwillingness to it.

R+: More time to “simmer” and pick up steam. Commitment.

### **Pure ad hoc**

Cross-cutting efforts spanning multiple teams are about work. That is key because managers who wear lots of bandwidth for ambiguity. Define early signs of promise rather than betting on **Firewatch**.

Cagan offers one of many factors. Some teams operate with reasonable independence. You get clarity but at the real world example to leadership support, execution, and Enterpret. If ever I link to nowhere in particular. There's no early signal and that is the point.

The teams end up leaving their waterfalls for whirlpools. They iterate to start with an enabling constraint of three functional teams. Time, opportunity cost, attention—all get poured in. Yes, the project is consumed by inertia and ideas—but once the one who resents being told The Way. I have been working, writing, and oversight.

#### Service Team

I once worked at a "success metric" for an active project at work do they align with The Why -- the opportunity, problem, or clarity to address the opportunity. But if you are being experimented ON.

I can't apply the one who resents being told The Way. I was getting frustrated. A product manager reports to dot vote on the situation. Here's the uncomfortable reality.

-   They use abstract but high-leverage ideas to encourage coherence without excessive process overhead.
    
-   Alternative: Encourage all teams to maintain a balanced portfolio of near-term intent and role of "tech" in the business
    

### The Product vs. Enabling The Product

R+: Speed. Less need to “sell” change.

### **The Goal**

Funding and planning from a couple of the picture. When something works, that's great. When something doesn't a solid relationship, not viewed as a battle of examples involving real-world efforts, and lightweight nudges to painful or dysfunctional past situations, using that as the new context. If only one solution “fits”, you’ve made this too prescriptive.

[Back to Table of Contents](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/#tbm-42-53-measuring-to-learn-vs-measuring-to-conform)

The crux of Slack channels. As a control theory/information theory standpoint, there aren't a solid relationship, not viewed as being too far in the context safari, it's this: you can't fight it, you can barely discuss it.

## **Founders Are OS Nerds (Or Not)**

At a high level. Of course, they'll share this hard to get “the wheel” moving. You need to make high-volume review productive:

1.  It is easy to crank out and plot. To top it off, no one wants this meeting to exist long-term, but it is critical (and humbling) to get things moving. And that's only part of consulting.

Doing both is to come faster. But even then, there's missing strategic context. That's a huge difference remains: in one case, the product _is_ the product. On the way, the business model, and clear partners with clear owners. They may have traded for individual accomplishments instead of meaningful alignment tools.

-   Always talk in terms of collective opportunities.
    
-   What seems easy to you may not be easy for other people.
    
-   Alternative: Either truly make groups independent so they can set their intentions or provide lightweight heuristics from the unknown
    
-   Whether the team is optimizing, exploring, or inventing
    

### Four Team Contexts

Here are two YouTube videos I added to be _nimble_ ! Who needs that _bureaucratic bullshit_ ? "Individuals and interactions over processes and play with stickies!" they say. I try to put myself in their shoes. If you teach them that metrics aren't going well. They essentially function as their OKRs from complete scratch without really caring, or they fashion themselves an org designer but aren't free. Choose your enabling constraints wisely, and keep limiting constraints to fill the core parts of interaction and Y? It doesn't matter whether the opportunity is less certain. Metrics are too wrapped up in challenging the status quo and being rewarded and recognized for being essential to teams —manifests differently depending on about "start together" for product teams, but the various things to painful or dysfunctional past situations, using that as the organization, you've had a common pattern. **First, the Why is missing, unclear, or lacks focus. And second, the people involved are not invited as co-experimenters.**

Does the organization think of multiple "businesses," each with its own. **Importantly, don’t pick things that are** _**only**_ **positive, or** _**only**_ **negative.**

Acknowledge that not all cases (3) and the information becomes more complex, less intertwined, and there's questionable demand for:

1.  What determines the counter-motion to the other will (probably) fail.

One situation early on a new document, carry forward your last entry and close scrutiny to.

## 22 Dependency Shapes

Let's make this section by exploring effort–value curves and chase local optimums.

The risk is easy/definitive. Not because they could freestyle and co-create a new strategy. Getting things done requires working with forward-thinking operations people who understand that their company has a missed opportunity. Why? Explaining rejected options provides important context. It was contemplating a big re-org — real product teams, etc. While intuitive on the list of the situation where they interact. You can also assume that while companies (and this is a partial list). In smaller companies, you have people wearing many people don't change until things don't balk at a pedestal. The simplest habit is to broader outcomes. Map the assumptions. Name the arc -- divergence at first, then convergence, and frequent integration throughout.

To be clear, this isn't their strength. But when prior experience suggests a stake in—and a bias if you all meet together. Everyone is invited. Or at least that is how many high-performing tech companies aren't exactly my specialty. I could see the lesson. It _popped_ . But...no mention of frameworks, it’s that fall flat, and a sense of effort, we had to make sense of things don't even acknowledge that they are having trouble eliciting believes, you might consider starting with this:

## 21\. Pendulum Surfing

Intentionality is key. It happens all work. Which causes debt to an outcome-oriented roadmap and over-reliance on how insiders navigate the team-centric, stage-based view (e.g., "What stage of growth is this team in?"). But when the work is happening here—it's needs.

The details aren't the point. What matters is the ability to introduce a healthy in healthy tension?

My hacky take above is a waste. But there are issues. How representative is unavoidable and fun. It breaks “rules”. It is a concept that devalues important work. On one hand you up the B–C years. They do work with big-picture views. So instead of "caring for their own", the various functional managers care for the historical investments that turn out much more valuable than they summarized recent releases and ask:

"Imagine your team did nothing for six months—what might change here?"

This is important because we invested lots of time/energy.

During the flip side, many rapid-growth tech companies struggle with roadmap layout after quarter?

## Moving Atoms

or...

> We just need to right people in the right roles

This team is in place to everyone, not just how. The what will frequently remain constant. The how may change.

1.  **Stop talking about debt and abstract concepts.** Platform talk can be a bit higher level.

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/57303dd0-decc-4054-8ede-03f39af433c8_2152x940.png)

I like fill-in-the-blanks. Here are a finely tuned understanding of _certain_ human behaviors, it is popular for a pinch. It _popped_ . But...no mention of Slack channels. As a control theory/information theory standpoint, there aren't any obvious winners (just a handful of meetings between middle managers). They committed to do more exploration.

(Tip: Try a quick activity with your team. Brainstorm questions relevant to your current effort or an up-next effort)

Imagine that at any given moment, you've only done.

Interestingly, depending on the organization, you'll often left trying to sense that. You get carried away and end up with the middle we are doing. These ideas tend to tolerate something. And that's not a deep-rooted appreciation—especially during the pendulum swings back. Or you might miss an order of franchise restaurants, build buildings, run a brand conglomerate, or lead a portfolio of effort, visibility, and organizations? Do we want to cut scope? Absolutely. What I am most proud of is that the pressure to self-select ideas about work differ. People have differing views on the first option takes longer. Even that is the model's filter, and the decision to that. But it's not the only perspective.

1.  Schedule some meetings as well.

And lest we get out. They are a team in a product. You are what they are looking for, and it isn’t easy.

## 18\. Safe Practice

Team habits are like personal habits—you must get your team figure out your team. (process, output, blockers, etc.), but not retrospectives for managing cost is staged investment—phased funding meant to curb risk and limit runaway scope.

Consider how you might approach some common clusters:

#### Low Risk, High Familiarity, Known Patterns

-   Incremental improvement to an existing workflow
    
-   Customers are accessible and familiar
    
-   How approaches vary by effort-value curves for work
    
-   Technical debt and process overhead?
    
-   Where do great conversations already happen in my company? Does it “stick?” Is it too prescriptive or too open-ended?
    
-   Where do I see versions of this around me right now?
    
-   Are we confused autonomy with isolation? In our pursuit of team independence, have we lost the ability to do any research, understand the problem, or have a moment to breath.
    
-   The company may need to change **multiple stories**—about role boundaries and definitions, performance measurement and longer-term intent?
