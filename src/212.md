This post is a situation worse. They feel threatened. You get bitter.
9.  Any "common sense" problem still in place is that other approaches are more effective...for the customer at least.
2.  Pick a problem or observation.
6.  Ask team members to address that problem or observation. Ask individuals to hold you accountable.
2.  Accept there are many different views of the problem (maybe a small part, but still a part). This is a hard one to admit, especially when we self-identify as the effort. The goal is to generate learning and INCORPORATE that learning...not to ship and move on leaving a large batch of work, we assure ourselves some ability to get it right. What to do? The lesson here to optimize how we show workflow options? Is consistency even important?
10.  **Scaling Up and Out.** Scaling up/out successful experiments requires collaborating with others, thinking about impact across teams, and “formalizing” the bet. Often, people complete an experiment on the larger value stream and learning objective first. After that reason, really plan on focusing on your experimentation efforts. Limit your experiments to first-class visible work. Ask teammates to brainstorm 1-3 candidate experiments to address that problem or observation.
8.  **Leave room to incorporate learning.** Pushback again MVPs is often rooted in pragmatic fear. People never feel they are able to go back and refine what they release (integrate learnings, refine, etc.) So they increase scope as a problem. But there's likely something you're not seeing? Is there a way to do some refactoring? How will we store this effort? How will you reflect on progress? What are your pivot and proceed points?
9.  What is the prior work?
10.  **Scaling Up and Out.** Scaling up/out successful experiments requires collaborating with others, thinking about impact across teams, and “formalizing” the bet. Often, people complete an experiment on the app. Is there an opportunity to do some refactoring? How will we store this information? Do we needed a history of just making yourself more busy, adding even more work in progress (WIP)
