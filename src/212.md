5. **Iteration 32: QEMU Path Fix & Test Integration** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Volatility and scheduling
   - Natural language intent creation
   - ⏳ Pending
   - ci-compile.py:296-297: Fixed UTF-8 encoding for Docker output streaming on Windows
   - Payer creates Stripe payment intent via AP2 Gateway
   - Uses merged binary approach: `--merged-bin -o qemu-build/merged.bin --defines FASTLED_ESP32_IS_QEMU` flags
   - Verification checklist

## 🤝 **Priority 3: Collaboration Features**

### 3. **Competitive Advantage > Efficiency**

Each agent is deployed to work across all JavaScript runtimes:

### Step 1: Sign Up for Railway

☑️ Add Matching Intent disabled
```

**convex/convex.config.ts:**

```typescript
// Pattern 1: Validate input before processing
8. Agent calls request_payment tool
         │ referenced by
         ↓
3. Railway will give you URLs for both of the request is approximately 0.000000001% (1 in 100 billion). Combined with multi-AZ replication, this provides enterprise-grade data protection.

### Platform Limits

**ALWAYS**:
- Match creation between bid/ask intents
- Consider: price overlap, asset types, timing, quantities
- Forgetting to dispose causes memory leaks as C++ objects aren't detected, power cycle the failure to callers instead of reloading

### 7. Integration Test
- [x] Intent submission via ERC-20 Transfer events
- [x] Ensure no content will be lost

**Available Folders:**
- `cadvisor_feature_flag: false` - Syslog-ng metrics exporter
- `pkg/gather/` - Data gathering logic and gatherer implementations
- `npm run lint` - Lint code with ESLint
- `InvalidFormatError` - Corrupted or invalid file
- `gather`: Privileged service account for various artifacts

### Creating a Release

Force refresh:

```python
# Create local WASM copy
python -c "pattern"                 # Count matches per file
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
asyncio = "^3.4.3"

# Filter by IP address
7. **Response Delivery**: Host POSTs response to `{tunnel_url}/respond`
are hosted in a separate repository:
```sql
docker/build-docker-image.sh al2023
```

### Application Issues

```typescript
// 5. Choose icons that users will intuitively understand
```

#### Streaming Export (Alternative Backup)

**Answer: NO, if:**
- 🎯 Matching Agent working... ✅

**Typical Execution Times:**

| Service | URL |
| ---------- | ----- |
| Pages Overview | <https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/> |
| Pages Functions | <https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/ |
| Hyperdrive | https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/ |
| Workers AI | https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/nextjs/ |
| D1 (SQLite) | https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/ |
| Wrangler Config | https://clerk.com/docs/reference/nextjs/overview |
| Catalog backbone | Build from scratch vs OpenMetadata vs DataHub | Hybrid with OpenMetadata | Use LIMIT/OFFSET pagination |
| 💧 Liquidity | 2-4s | Generates quote |

**Technical Guarantee:**

1. Broaden search terms and dropdown options
19. performance.rst - Merge with tags.rst
3. **Never Create Custom Buttons** - Always use `<auto-button>`
3. Modify `.cuti/agents.json` and reload
7. **Structure**: Use proper heading hierarchy (H1 > H2 > H3)

## Common Patterns by Page Type

### Layout
- **Multi-turn**: After tool call, LLM can generate final response
- **9093**: Alertmanager web interface
- **Winner data**: tag, startingTrophies, trophyChange, crowns, kingTowerHitPoints, princessTowersHitPoints, clan info
- **Solution**: Removed `-mb-4` from all modal footer classes
- **Before**: Link only shown after 120+ second confirmation wait
- **Own File Storage**: Separate file storage independent from the main application
- **Automatic caching**: Convex caches query results for exports
