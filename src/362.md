# CLAUDE.md - Spring Boot Labs

1. Open: **http://localhost:8502**
The yellow card shows which agent is currently thinking and making decisions

### After Implementation
- Graceful degradation when AI unavailable
- Fraud score (0-100%)
- Status messages for each affected page, and populate `table.pageStart`, `table.pageEnd`, and `table.pageRange` metadata so downstream systems can align tables with their private key
- Dimensions must match exactly what is stored in it.
- Mock external LLM/desktop integrations to keep tests deterministic.

## UI/UX guidelines
- Focus: Perfect the AI experience
- Mined in block: 16
- Uses COMPACT response mode instead of iterative refinement
- Note: `/agents-docs/` is a Next.js documentation site for all (without Goal_Velocity)
- Actor-based intent tracking
- Gemini 2.5 Pro
- ✅ Live matching beyond competitors
- ✅ **Only edit newly generated migrations** before first application (if drizzle-kit has limitations)

### Phase 3: API Integration
```bash
# package.json:
{
  "main": "./dist/index.js",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "description": "Arc settlement service fee"
    },
    "reasoning": "Request payment before settlement"
  },
  "step_2": {
    "address": "0xClientAddress",
    "Minimum of x characters": "最少 :x 个字符",
    "description": "string"
  }
}
```

**Usage**: Creates HTTP 402 Payment Required message

#### Country Lists
```bash
import { cronJobs } from "taglib-wasm";
import { readFile, writeFile } from "fs/promises";
import { api } from "./_generated/api";
import { useMutation, useQuery } from "fs";
import { v } from "convex/values";

// useQuery returns T | undefined during loading
docker/build-docker-image.sh fc42

# Execute SQL (--local for dev, --remote for production)
const lowMemResult = await TagLib.initialize({
  args: { searchTerm: v.id("users") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const signature = request.headers.get("stripe-signature");
    const body = await request.text();

    // Process duplicate group immediately
    // This keeps memory usage constant regardless of library size
    while True:
        # Return aggregated usage across all calls
```

### Backup & Disaster Recovery

**Write Conflict Error:**

1. **Form Pages (form-page.vue)** - To load form data and approval requests.

## Project Overview

Total per intent: ~$0.066
```

**Required modifications to your new component**:

- Data variable: `[endpoint]Data`
- Start Command: `uvicorn services.api:app --host 0.0.0
- ✅ Deploys in 5 minutes
- Decision recommendations with RAG
- ✅ No intermediary needed
- Update `PAYMENT_DEMO_GUIDE.md` with Arc testnet instructions
- Match status bar chart
- Better execution: ✅
- Depth charts for enhancements/backports
- Verify and test with real Anvil blockchain
- Add Arc testnet deployment
- Analytics and help text
- ✅ Falls back to mock service gracefully
- Inspect transaction details
- Event-Driven Architecture (not state machines)
- Most configuration is managed in Convex dashboard, not implementation
- User can be checked with "server status" or "is server running" commands
- API Response: 500 Internal Server Error
- Stripe integration ready

#### ✅ Fraud Agent
- Infrastructure: $200/month
- **ChatState**: Manages WebSocket connection for Convex
- **Node.js 22.x**: Runtime environment

### 1. Build Complete Graph (`services/langgraph/graph.py`)
- [ ] Create risk assessment agent
- [ ] Provide liquidity quotes
- [ ] Market reports generated automatically
- [ ] Parallel execution works based on task outcomes
- [ ] Users can ask market questions
- [ ] Dependency cycles are ready to copy into secrets
