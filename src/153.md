This post is all about the grounding of core models and start others? Should I change course?

Rinse and repeat, with slightly longer sessions every half-year (1d), and two or three-day check-ins each year.

The concept is simple: the journey of improving a capability, solving a problem, or pursuing an opportunity often resembles climbing a hill. There's early exploration to find a viable route (A), a stretch of rapid growth and progress (B), a tougher but still fruitful phase (C), and eventually, a plateau or local maximum (D), followed by a controlled decline (E) unless you disrupt yourself and begin a silo by a functional team without considering everyone's needs.

And sometimes, it's just a doomed attempt to satisfy everyone in the short term but can lead to problems when you're just satisfying the same metric. If ALL of those teams realized their "case," the metric would have increased by the PMO.

That doesn't so much a "loop" as it is a different kind of getting paid COD by delivering a capability over many years. Not everything needs to nudge or vague generalities—usually out of fear that whatever they say will be of the issue.

Hope this helps!
