# AGENTS.md

1. **UI Currency Display**: Still shows ETH instead of USDC
   - **Impact**: Low (backend works correctly)
   - **Fix**: Update UI component labels and formatting
   - **Workaround**: Settlement Agent fees use USDC, escrow uses ETH
   - **Asset to Buy**: BTC
   - **Runtime:** Python 3
   - **Future**: Add ERC-20 support to AuctionEscrow contract

2. **Data Understanding and Exploration**
   - User submits intent via UI/SDK
   - Only proceed to settlement AFTER payment confirmed

✅ Key Achievements:
   Initial skills compiled: 65
   from anthropic import Anthropic

   client = Anthropic(api_key="sk-ant-...")
   response = client.messages.create(
       model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
       max_tokens=1024,
       value=10.0
   )
   ```

5. **Update Display Currency**: Lines 182-185, 334, 478
   - Connected: True

⚠️ **Warning**: Only proceed with changes highlighted. Alerts on major moves (funding, product launch, pricing change).

### 2. Subagent Strategy (When Risk Is High)
- Changed default payment amounts from Anvil may have priority 0
- ✅ Error handling throughout
- Convoy progress tracking
- Simulate client paying for settlement
- ✅ Mock service for any potential breaking changes

**After Fix**:
- Filter by active/unmatched status
- Match status updates

#### **AuctionEscrow.sol** - `/contracts/src/AuctionEscrow.sol`
- Quick start: `PAYMENT_QUICK_START.md` with USDC setup steps
- Team availability not considered

**Risk Scoring**:
```
0. PAYMENT PROCESSING (NEW - x402 Protocol)
   - Fallback resilience

This repository contains 100+ infrastructure-as-code recipes for your project tool, sends setup checklists, monitors completion, escalates to human when stuck, schedules kickoff calls.

### Issue: Transaction fails with "revert"

**Step 2**: Agent cards appear
- All 6 agents work independently and together
- Match status updates

#### **Auction Engine** - `/services/auction_engine.py`
2. Follow naming convention: `@rytass/category-adapter-provider` or `@rytass/category`
3. Implement source/sink interfaces from `seatunnel-e2e/seatunnel-engine-ui

# Run example integrations
cd outputs && docker-compose up -d`

### Branch Strategy
- Speed: <100ms

### After Completion
- Incomplete model documentation (only 2 of 15+ models documented)
- Examples located in `seatunnel-examples/seatunnel-engine-examples/src/main/resources/examples/`
- Linters & formatters: `eslint.config.js`, `jest.mocks/`
- Write simple, deterministic unit tests
- Validate examples against current best practices

## 🌱 Closing Words

The navigation system works as follows:

1. **Getting Started** - Installation and initial setup
2. **Production Deployment**: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

---

## 🎯 Key Points

Status: ✅ Running
source venv/bin/activate && streamlit run ui/streamlit_app.py` - Fixed imports
4. ✅ Implement fraud pattern detection
│   │   └── model-form.vue
flutter test_agentic_system.py

# Start the package for Fedora 41
flyctl auth login

# Assign to GitHub Secrets:
# Settings → Secrets → New repository secret
# FIRST CHOICE - List all files/dirs recursively:
import { readFile } from "taglib-wasm";
import { v } from "convex/values";

// SLOW: Sequential approach
rg "pattern" -g "*.md"          # Only Markdown
npm create cloudflare@latest -- my-app --template hono
```

### Verify Task Installation
```bash
./mvnw compile -DskipUT=true
```

### 2. Deploy to Arc Testnet
```powershell
INFO:__main__:→ Executing liquidity_agent
3. **Watch Real-Time Execution** - See agents run live with progress indicators
5. Maintained backward compatibility

**15+ Endpoints**:
- `LMHandler` (`rlm/core/lm_handler.py`): Multi-threaded TCP server wrapping LM clients
- `FileOperationError` - File read/write errors
- `gather`: Privileged service account for various artifacts

### During Development (Current Setup)

```bash
# Update data files (sources from data-raw/ scripts)
gt mayor attach
```

## Presentation Design Patterns

### ❌ DON'T vs ✅ DO

| Module Characteristics | Use First-Level | Use Sub-Level |
|----------------------|------------------|---------------|
| Single main action | ✅ First-level | ❌ |
| All `Id<"table">` become strings at boundary | ID types don't cross boundaries |
| No `process.env` access | Components can't access environment variables |
| Next.js | https://clerk.com/docs/reference/react/overview |
| No Memory | 98.8% | 3.28 | 75.0% | 136 |
| Database | Dedicated PostgreSQL vs shared with HMS | Shared server, separate database | Operational simplicity, clean isolation, trivial migration |
| Quick access needed | ✅ First-level | ❌ |
| T3: Destructive | High | Drop table, rename table, remove user from group | Generate plan only (v1); 48-hour delay + soft delete (v2) |

**Dry-run system**: T2/T3 actions validate before execution — check for name conflicts, downstream references (from `discovered_facts`), recent query activity. Results shown to reviewer before confirmation.

**convex/schema.ts:**

```bash
# Check if port is in use
const audioFile3 = await TagLib.initialize();
app.use(rateLimiter, { name: "rateLimit" });
app.use(rateLimit, { name: "agent" });
app.use(agent, { name: "agent" });
export default app;
```

**Technical Explanation:**

- **All user data encrypted at rest** in Convex deployments
- Historical volatility calculation
- ✅ 27/27 tests passing
- README.rst: Project overview and bar charts using Plotly
- Mandate-based settlement with signature
- Verify cross-region compatibility where applicable
- Each class has `.from_idtag(tag)` auto-detects type from first character

### 6. First Agent Implementation
- [x] List all files in docs/ directory (33 RST files total)
- [x] Market Agent (Market intelligence)
- [x] Market Agent (Pattern detection)
- [x] Fraud Agent (Pattern detection)
- [x] Comprehensive error handling

### For Development (Current Setup)

```typescript
// 🔍 Search: "inventory", "boxes", "warehouse", "stack"
// ✅ Found: fa-chart-line (represents data trends)
```

### Root Cause

1. Go to https://railway.app
│   │   ├── verified-badge.md
uv --version
```

## Pull request expectations
2. Market Risk (25%): Volatility, position size, concentration
│   ├── matching_agent.py         ✅ Base class

## 📊 Technical Specifications

### Mode 3: Multi-Currency Support
- ✅ Mock service for ESP32-C3 parallel features
- ❌ Environment variables
- If a change reveals deeper issues:
  - feature flags, config switches, or safe defaults.

### Error Handling Philosophy

### Jaeger Tracing Debugging
4. View pie chart and add to .env
npx convex run myFunction --prod
```

### Development Commands
```bash
2. Navigate to **Cloudflare Dashboard > Workers & Pages > Create > Pages > Connect to Git**
3. Fill in the response

**Why Use Components Instead of npm Packages?**

| Feature | npm Package | Convex Component |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| State Persistence | In-memory (lost on restart) | Database-backed (persistent) |
| API Cost/Month | $4,500-13,500 | $60 | ✅ Revised (99% cheaper) |
| Overlay Network | AWS Cloud Map / Service Connect |
| Order belongs to Product | ✅ `orders.product_id` | ❌ |
| Multiple related actions | ❌ | ✅ Sub-level |

### 3. Audited Skill Graph

This is a research prototype. Contributions welcome in:

- **10 diverse intents** across multiple assets (BTC, ETH, USDC)
- **Distributions**: Violin plots, box plots, or histograms
- **Expandable Sections** - Detailed drill-downs
- **Dynamic options**: Use `build_form` to get related data

### Modern Spring Boot Patterns
- **@docusaurus/theme-search-algolia**: Algolia search integration
- **@docusaurus/preset-classic**: Default Docusaurus plugin bundle
- **@docusaurus/theme-search-algolia**: Algolia search integration
- **@docusaurus/preset-classic**: Default Docusaurus plugin bundle
- **@docusaurus/preset-classic**: Default Docusaurus plugin bundle
- **@docusaurus/plugin-pwa**: Progressive Web App support
- **Planning**: Multi-step execution, error handling, fallback strategies
- **Admin permission** is checked automatically against folder requirements
- **MCP Protocol**: Standardized integration with doubled particle counts and API
- **Integration Patterns**: Connect with Gmail, Slack, Notion, etc.
- **Before attempting to delete a file to resolve a local type/lint failure, stop and ask the user.** Other agents are met (e.g., specific alerts firing)
- **Authorization in code**: Check auth at function level (no RLS framework)

### Agent Decomposition: 3 Agents, Not 7

### Important Files
- **Memory efficient** batch processing
- **Balances**: Before/after comparison

## ✅ Next Immediate Steps

This package can be collected and verified BEFORE executing settlement.
```

**Common Causes:**

1. **List Pages (list-page.vue)** - To load form data and complete testing remain as next steps.
