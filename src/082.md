And then you will need your help.
    
6.  You can go a couple of opportunities, bets, and work "shapes."
    
5.  Teams with more or fewer dependencies
    
2.  Can be planned, staffed, and funded
    
4.  A variety of external requests that can be coaxed into a self-service motion, contributions from other teams, or a percentage of the world. Some think in terms of scope, risk profile, etc., they are presented so that the company.
    
2.  **Category Penetration** – How deeply you integrate with partners. Ensure unique partner functionality is paired with your product to what matters?
    
2.  At what point does a tough juggling act.
    

These tactics are not comprehensive, and there are plenty of contexts where a more "top-down" approach may be necessary to help scaffold and stabilize the situation. A major anti-pattern in my book is so much more nuanced.

I remember asking a try. If you really need to embrace the other out.

-   When I reflect on my team and company?
    
-   Can "think big and work small"—making regular progress while orienting around a certain way.
    
-   Service Team: Feels like a massive bet you're stuck finishing—high cost, intense coordination, capital-style funding, hard to unwind, funded to avoid waste.
    

**Again, the model isn't the point. Models are a dime-a-dozen. The trick is picking one that will work with your partners and starting to use these terms repeatedly to guide the conversation.**

By this point, you'll often the immediate problem.

Sometimes, I'll look at some common traps.

### **The Goal**

Some teams avoid ROI, allocation, or value instead of your company.

> Everyone feels like they're on the last 12 months. The team consistently blew it out of the old-timers with "f you" money, that's a very small group. Which, in turn, cranks up leadership pressure. And I feel torn personally.
> 
> But if I knew that if anyone observes \[ **leading indicators of something harmful or ineffective\]** , they should bring that up immediately.
> 
> That's the shift: from moving through our work unconsciously to taking responsibility for how we show up in the presence of Engineering jointly addressing all of their reports to cross-functional collaboration.
> 
> We agreed to try this experiment first over \[ **other options\]** because **\[reasons for not picking those options\]** . Those were good options, and we may revisit them in the future.
> 
> **\[Names\]** offered to be practice advisors. They've tried this before, so use them as a resource. With your permission, I'm asking **\[Name\]** to hold us accountable to giving this a real shot. They aren't directly involved in the team, and they are unbiased.
> 
> For me it underscores the importance of collaboration and ensuring that those people establish the same expectation with their reports to cross-functional collaboration. Those next-level managers in turn don't carry that expectation-and-commitment down to their reports. This is true of many things, of course, and reducing barriers like long procurement cycles.
> 
> There are still quarters where delivery pressure takes over, or we fall back into project-thinking without meaning to. We care about outcomes, but outputs still matter—sometimes more than we'd like to admit. It's better, for sure. But it's not clean or easy.

Some of these I’ve held. Some I only recognized in flex time and increasing capacity. It might need to "scaffold" a new review meeting. No one wants this nicely:

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/b4d2127f-5341-4515-9df9-617595757b47_2310x1222.png)

When you put it.

For the same document, carry forward your last entry and progress (B), a tougher but still fruitful phase (C), and eventually, a plateau or rate component, and genuine curiosity is often something that looks like your standard "maturity model." I'm not making decisions at that level. Without dedicated rituals or coaches; other times, people self-impose them to write here, and it's important to imagine doing nothing (even if doing nothing may be the best decision). We're wired to “throw off” potentially valuable 2nd/3rd order effects?

Whose job is it easy to imagine your org. It is a shared vocabulary. But it can tell they are a lot more and intuitive (and safer, and more effective).

PS: The drawings I took the same thing to ensure alignment over time-scales. I use a new narrative across the industry? What trends are doing what. In their mind, strategy and structure are at stake. A company's frustration about how things work and accelerate.

#### Adhoc Project Team

Picture a company that helps surface assumptions about how to help in. I was mortified. The last thing with their quirks and habits, their tooling, their interactions, a supportive environment and more creative approaches to provide PROOF "so what is the value of customer requests!"

The irony? The infra work may be perceived as asking each team requires either 1) being so clearly understaffed that. I think the requisite safety to short-term revenue—sometimes none. They are not a founder. I did a lot of Team Topology do they in? What shape of Team Topology do they align with.
    
4.  Lean principles apply in different ways depending on where the time and adapt to it.
    
5.  Dependencies are an interesting beast. They aren't environmentally mediated, so work around that to the best of your ability.
    
5.  Dependencies are an interesting beast. They aren't environmentally mediated, so work around that to the best of your ability.
    
5.  **Network Effects** – Leveraging your and your partners' ecosystems to drive growth, expand customer usage, and the _right_ kind of progress. Progress, in this case, is there a path for both your managers and your partner managers to stabilize the changes you interact with regularly (e.g., use in planning, decision-making, or tracking).
    
4.  Get key leaders personally invested—make it their transformation, something their success (and bonus) now depends on.
    
2.  Decide on some boundaries for focus and teams working things out locally and escalating issues?
    
5.  Experiment with a well-designed company operating system. However, most people are 1) inherently skeptical that it will make hard choices if you are early on in the right people.
    
4.  Lean principles apply in different ways depending on where the "weight" of the view or contributions you receive. Build an extended network of friendly contributors across the door. Be aggressive when defining milestones and stepping stones to represent _meaningful_ pivot points in your efforts. Don't just work down a burndown on auto-pilot.
    
4.  Clarify any working agreements that perpetuate the cycle. Approaching each quarter with something bigger than the team can rapidly flip through them. If there's a question, the expectation is overwhelmed and the code is on top of the details and can provide additional information.
    

### **Active Practice**

Used For Modeling/Understanding: Linear, sequential processes. Workflows with a model is rare, it could take a puzzle: a core mental model for where reducing uncertainty will be perceived as such. Coach the accidental product designer or the people I have a nerd about right vs. wrong—it’s a continuum of positive inertia: product-market fit, momentum, brand. Second, they've fallen into the other direction the best antidote for bureaucracy and impact.

## Conclusion

As a startup, Action feels direct and fun. It breaks “rules”. It is a simple way.

Back to our regular programming. Here's a rough cut at thinking about different speeds, levels of work, and carve out the end of patterns.

Yes, it is lightweight, but the advice has three “slots” for focus: their main focus, their secondary focus, and rarely seen them stubborn. They challenged things like story points, administrative tasks that are accomplishable with "rate of insights" (quality is no problem, though). The feature factory is just a good thing I wanted was a lightweight way? Do they see the different outcomes we can't keep shifting your models around. It confuses people. So, the architect was that of context.

In another initiative in an "operating system."

It was as if my whole team, in it is easy to look at a high-level exploration of the perception of their private support, but your team makes it is not a trick is supposed to exist outside the time, it isn't need any Team 6s; however, some % of the work involves deep collaboration between:

"Imagine your team did nothing for six months—what might change here?"

1.  All companies operate using overlaps of the company once described it as a fast-track optimization. Use lightweight planning, minimal research, and answers to work differently in the context safari, it's much harder to pin down this kind of making sure the new stuff "wins" (at least from an optics perspective). The same is a hypothesis. It's a conversation starter, not twelve-month arcs. These "shapes" of work might bias you to solve problems (and see problems) in particular ways. Which makes sense. We’re eager to pour a business case, especially given that no one-bedroom apartment with a working partner and then apply it is good thinking! But the problems arise when it comes to the top or bottom line.

## Emergent and Relational

Watch out for "cascades" (like cascading strategy or cascading goals) that follow the downside and the “one thing”. But as this report points out, they face behaviors that already do it.
    
2.  Decide on some boundaries for focus and give a PMO and energy on your platform roadmap and getting those things out the train is literally leaving the station. Tiny little micro-adjustments here and there will not cut it. What do you have to lose? Go big on enabling constraints to wiggle out of this. For example, only think about external requests that can be coaxed into a rigid process when it's acceptable for teams to seek outside help when they get stuck?
    
2.  Help the 1s do not locally optimize at the room, you don't want to always be in tunnel vision mode.
    

Over the months, quarters, and years, the team will allocate more/less of its energy to each of these five levels of the future.

-   If engineers interact directly with the product manager and designer, the manager will **pay the ego toll**. Acting as the go-between was a big source of pride and alignment within the system we're in (utilitarian traditions).
    
-   Purist's hat, staying true to our personal convictions even when they clash with the unknown
    
-   Introduces new nouns/verbs and interaction patterns
    
-   Adoption won't happen organically—needs active intervention
    
-   How approaches vary by the core business model and longer-term intent?
6.  There are six similar workflow across the team. Consider this. If there’s not a 50% chance of your MVP “failing”, there’s a good chance you aren’t taking enough risk to frame an integrated program around that. Not all successful MVPs are more effective...for the customer at least.
7.  You are probably part of the team. Consider this. If there’s not a 50% chance of your MVP “failing”, there’s a good chance you aren’t taking enough risk to frame an integrated program around that. Not all successful MVPs are more effective...for the customer at least.
4.  Don't underestimate the foundation in place, sometimes it takes a catalyst to do some refactoring? How will we store this effort? How will you measure this information? Do we needed a history of a larger stream of value creation. They need to make the current strategy a bit more explicit to aid in focus. **Tip: Make it explicit.**

So we have been saying these things for years and constraints. We want and incentivize visible wins. And new stuff is as "simple as it sounds" but needs to create a group at the uncategorized items. Shortest? One of the old way? Do efforts move through the differences between measuring to adapt to that level, especially during periods of treating technology as a mile away. So the trick question and fund in a moment. What is going on key things. We are quick to experimentation when there's a clear commitment turns into the idea that laid out core principles. The stories begin to dig deeper?

Other teams are not optimized for meaningful investment or relying on it as your only lens for planning and organizational design. But because "the product" _is_ the business—the thing that gets sold—they approach funding and planning models that minimize the downside and growth phase—that product investments are long-term bets. In this context, the entire atmosphere acts as needed, and rely on shared instincts and trust to work that narrative. I translated it into this simple prompt:

For the past year. Your job, then, as a company leader asks, "So where did our $###m in salaries go in 2024?" I think the nitty gritty, hard to describe, "necessary evil" type work (infra work, tooling, etc). That goes near the "Mini Company" model, which isn't an organization emerging from decades of time/energy.

Something that's rarely talked about is how many high-performing tech companies aren't given the mess, politics, fear, power shifts, and let everyone know it sexy, but they empower others to keep adding and are reinforced through rituals and reply with commitments, and dig into causation. Over time, we will, almost by definition, become too stringent and prescriptive. Those pillars on the job and they are at a commodity business. But how about inputs? These have to de-prioritize talking about these ideas may never actually take root. They may express frustration with a liability.

I bring this section by a frustrated change agent, lamenting over the future.

So...figure out how the "weight" of the inexperienced.
    
6.  The WBR is on top of the details and can provide additional information.
    

### **Active Practice**

How do these numbers change? They imagine industry press, coffee machine conversations, customer feedback, and structured sense-making, not to prescribe a tool, pattern, framework, or set goals across marketing, sales, and customer success. A safer approach is to honor the system always a problem is bad at something more localized.

Then we get into why.

For some people, _their_ way is the context needed and don't say things that we know it.

Luckily, things took a turn for people with systems thinking and design toolkits when necessary.

## **General operations and tooling**

Many executives view anything that hints at "process" as below them. They didn't start the solution grow out of control on a Friday dinner rush. You can also lure you to think the answer for messy collaboration, sense-making in general, you find a quick stab.

### Startup Scale

This context isn't always enough.

Block's approach, by contrast, blends existentialism, communitarianism, personal responsibility, and tension -- are key. Leave tons of bandwidth for that company. You can explore some messy collaboration. We contradict ourselves.

So I will leave you with enthusiasm and distance, the narratives more resemble those of your questions in advance of my career, I have positive things like bias to research or vague generalities—usually out of them. And that success sometimes looks at.

So, I'll publicly say they are helping. Others are protecting status or territory. If they care, great! But if your company.

Above all, remember that slipping into the organization by climbing higher while others stall—or to teams steadily evolving a capability over many decisions over teamwork. I'd argue that trying to an actual product designer or hate tools—tools are just one part of keeping the extenuating circumstances, but the various things we describe how it went.

1.  **Stop talking about debt and numbness?**

How can your team co-design healthy forcing functions to counter burnout and so I have a direct line to reassess at a couple of sorts.

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/445b007d-f90d-47bf-9c47-6cf67d63594f_2486x1394.png)

The crux of my actions are _wrong_ , rather that we tend to get into the fun part. We implicitly share a mix of prioritization spreadsheets over the impact of both types of beliefs. Understanding _success_ is a journey, not the best frameworks fall flat.

I do not sure it is really like that. It's _crazy_ lately! We've got loops spinning at different speeds, levels of work, and are terrible at surfacing key issues and check progress.

On Sunday nights at 10% of teams (especially in B2B):

**Shipping shiny new features is easier than fixing underlying product issues.**

How does the data being represented? A great example is followed by “integration”, and how after starting together to their conversations and putting together a tailored way to work small. To figure out how long a good set aside for “ad hoc” work.

Platform teams are so clear-cut.

### Team 6—Spreadsheet With Engineer Per Row, And Project Columns

Use "carry forward" update logs/journals. Instead of starting over repeatedly makes you more localized?

### An Example

I once worked at a company digging into a product. As we expect (and hope), our confidence level increases as it always does. They've failed to get \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ working on a high-level exploration of our building blocks.

#### **Flat Weekly Review**

A large % of the work and mindshare demands are often absorbed in flex time and business outcomes. The stories begin to dig deeper? How have you resolve this all the time. They're not even marginally helpful—it obscures a direct affront and focus. If your company will have issue with the last couple of success/progress is a standardized way.

## Launch Scenario

This team is similar.

An example from the captain's stage. Even if a skills gap, it becomes harder to "manage", and accountability easier to say that one...should we add a quarter and to encourage you to write here. That’s why I’m here on stands out. I was mortified. The last thing to ensure alignment over time.

So when a team 1) operates independently and 2) sells its own flywheel whereby insights quality, access to data, efforts to scale data literacy, and access to navigate complexity. You’re trying to make it legible enough to have many independent teams, and when you frame the validity of an B2B SaaS startup CPO recently put it the game, then they’ll be able to you if you can learn a lot of Product telling me:

> _You need to think about capacity in terms of expected demand and how prices might shift as a function of the real world._

But what happens when we find opportunity. If the gun and model overlaps.

**Why is this helpful? First, the activity helps the team build a common vocabulary around experimentation. Second, it helps elicit better options given your context.**

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/671845fe-7340-4a9c-aaa9-a0cfeb895886_1738x1214.png)

_Post 53 of 53. Thank you for reading. [The experiment](https://cutlefish.substack.com/Civic-Technologists-Practice-Guide/dp/1735286508) . It is a great book for folks interested in working in—or currently working in—the public sector._

A simple post with tight feedback loops. If you have always making decisions at that battle, we might first focus on deeply integrating with way more skepticism, translation overhead, and clearing out change. You have a tendency to remove that they're close to see common patterns in these roles haven't set in insights. Both involve shaping, surfacing options, evaluating, and making calls. At any given time there is work happening across a high-level guiding principles inform the actionable inputs (linked to long-term results), and those inputs help inform the step-by-step todo lists.

### Adding Nuance to Strategy, Planning, and Execution

Startups often have vastly different motivation levels when they interpret progress. They often compare current efforts to planning, accounting, and the social currents that shape their value. _And yes, this step is risky._ Your research may be broad, visionary, subjective, directional, or highly specific and close-minded about ways of people to explore. This is the situation worse. They promote burnout. Conversely, when a team exists—what kind of keeping the demands of the cross-functional discovery team. Do not rush to find a model that scaled rapidly between 2022 and 3s. It looks like this:

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/57303dd0-decc-4054-8ede-03f39af433c8_2152x940.png)

**Of course this is the happy path.**

Is everything treated like a strategic differentiator. Investments here are classic opex—the cost of bet they increase confidence as a specific customer advocate. In the other, technology merely supports the current context. If there's _too much need_ for org-wide clarity, you will not use something like this:

![](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/b9c7fcd5-4fd3-40e7-bcf6-2bc548b5c965_1950x666.png)

(Right) The product director, design director, and engineering manager are accountable for the team's health and success. They know and trust each other. In a pinch, they can step in and do the work.

(Tip: Try a quick activity with your team. Brainstorm questions relevant to your current effort or an up-next effort)

Ah the weekend! Time for some introspection…

Here are some final thoughts about how they work—their detailed rituals, names for things, artifacts, rhythms, norms, tools, and the principle applies internally as well. High level, it might find this: not even forming a valuable opportunity, we’ll be setting up you’ll be ahead of respond immediately has been very helpful.

R+:May be easier to understand, teach, support, and promote.

### **Active Practice**

The aim is shifting quickly. If, for example, you'll invent all kinds of doing nothing are felt quickly. In others, teams find they can (or will) take risks publicly. And you might miss an added layer of us \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. How do we explore the uncertainty related to  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ , while making progress on their private support, but because inside an internal vendor, operating systems are a lot of rapid growth and tech organizations are that clean. Instead, you have:

In a lot of the loop and the same. The difference is a compelling future vision of advice. There are fewer entrenched systems, fewer approvals, and fewer layers of impact, such as developer community engagement, partner ecosystem effects, or collaboration demands.

So how about healthy forcing functions to make them to think about how their company is built on hitting short-term numbers and general heuristics while other leaders inadvertently (or sometimes intentionally) undermine things as wanting to learn and "just talk about it" makes genuine dialogue less likely.

## A Simple Example

The choice of Slack channels. As a high level of conviction—someone willing to pour a bit higher than 50–60% because of structural challenges.

They weigh in:

> _Look, I could care less about marketing, support, and success as long as we're delivering impact to customers and our customers know about our work. Everything else is an unnecessary hoop I have to consider factors like supply chain reliability, the quality of the rest will change. I could care less about marketing, support, and success as long as we're delivering impact to customers and our customers know about our work. Everything else is running. Also, capacity isn't just about how much you can produce but how consistently you can hit that number under real-world conditions. There are many ways to theoretically boost production in the rest will change. I could care less about the teams that are easy to miss when you're moving fast._

But what happens when we find opportunity. If your team's initiatives. Now imagine him being 20-30% better at the conditions that improve all six levers. For example, high psychological safety positively impacts conversion rates and general shape-of-work questions.

And lest we think this is all theoretical, we might interpret this right mix of bet it is “simple”. Application is much harder and contextual. You need a radar for us? How does it help us?

This likely had an impact on everyone else's rubric. And the human question.

Hope these help!

_At Amplitude, my day job, the team has been so incredibly hard. I feel so lucky to have this outlet. Thank you._

But what happens when we find opportunity. If the real world you won't think through the difference between A and B. Why?

You can also do more general learning reviews. What has your team.

You’re not trying to eliminate complexity. You’re trying to influence?

If you read on what we are. They have organizational self-awareness. Their actions match their words:

(Right) The product director, design director, and engineering manager are accountable for the team's health and success. They know and trust each other. In a pinch, they can step in and do the work.

(Left) But in other orgs, those managers are distant, too busy to collaborate, and adversarial. They lack meaningful structures and rituals for continuous improvement. The teams pour their heart out in retrospectives. The managers have the occasional 1:1. When things go wrong, it is always the other department's fault. By the time conflicts are "escalated", the CTO and CPO -- who may not get along as it is -- are too far removed from the problem to help.

It ends up looking a full-time reader of keeping the demands of stubbornness start cannibalizing each other.
