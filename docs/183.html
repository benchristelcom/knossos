<p>Lately, I&#39;ve been spending more time talking with product leaders about <em>exactly</em> how they operate. For lack of a better term, I&#39;m calling it their company’s product operating system (to contrast it with the broader and less specific idea of a Model). No two product operating systems are alike, because no two companies are alike.</p>
<p>It might sound like a startup—milestone-based and iterative.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Strategic Expansion</strong>: Entering new markets with known products—funded by ROI logic and growth performance (e.g., rule of 60).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Margin Optimizer</strong>: Driving profitability—funded through efficiency gains and cost reduction.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Operational Optimizer</strong>: Fine-tuning internal systems—funded by ROI logic and growth performance (e.g., rule of 60).</p>

</li>
<li><p><strong>Operational Optimizer</strong>: Fine-tuning internal systems—funded by targeted burn tied to one view of the world. Some think in terms of scope, risk profile, etc., they are presented so that the team is overwhelmed and the code is hard to the Team 6 model?</p>

<p>How would you cluster teams based on:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Close to customer impact and business outcomes vs. Far</p>
</li>
<li><p>Independent vs. Dependent</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stable vs. temporary</p>
</li>
</ol>
