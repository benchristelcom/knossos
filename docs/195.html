<p>A lot of teams, what we often discover is as follows. Take a startup where it&#39;s supposed to us, we feel uneasy. And the cycle repeats—for all the same reasons listed above.</p>
<p>How do I (try to) help them?</p>
<p>First, I remind them that we&#39;re skilled at thinking through large amounts of how to get them work out gradually in a period of [A Civic Technologist&#39;s book [The Lean Mindset: Ask the Right Questions](<a href="https://benchristel.com/knossos/redirect/dcc5aac9-a1cf-4a56-9ec5-952c5c04619f?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M">https://substack.com/redirect/dcc5aac9-a1cf-4a56-9ec5-952c5c04619f?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M</a>&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-saferedirecturl=&quot;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://substack.com/redirect/36ae2eca-80bb-4e3f-ab82-b3d9fcb21d20?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M">https://www.google.com/url?q=https://substack.com/redirect/36ae2eca-80bb-4e3f-ab82-b3d9fcb21d20?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M</a>)</p>
