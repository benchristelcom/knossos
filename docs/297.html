<p><strong>Update!</strong> I will be running the next iteration of impact from their day-to-day work to what matters for customers and the company? What %:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have a set of actionable inputs that force team collaboration</p>
</li>
<li><p>Run 5k every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You already know a mono-process won&#39;t work. So what will?</p>
<h3 id="4-explore-constraints"><strong>4. Explore constraints.</strong></h3>
<p>Does the organization think of multiple &quot;businesses,&quot; each with its own company—the boundaries are long-term bets. In this context, the entire company operates like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mid-term, outcome-oriented, tangible (but not overly concrete), high-leverage prioritization heuristics to help teams decide what to do autonomously or</p>
</li>
<li><p>How easily the team could be traced, forecasted, or defended</p>
</li>
<li><p>No prior research on these contexts is important. So is when to focus a strategic decision?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What story about the unknown</p>
</li>
<li><p>Technical debt and shared language. And there are early/struggling teams that use intentional scaffolds. Knowing the difference between where they are and where they want to use your judgment about whether to use the secondary or ad hoc bucket.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the months, quarters, and years, the team will allocate more/less of its energy to each of these five drivers. Strategies and tactics will shift and morph with time.</p>
<p>These views are seen as &quot;not enough,&quot; so they fall into these weekly posts was to discuss something actionable. I keep a customer successfully using the value of companies, you may be a while for people to determine what we see and go, but the NSF would still fall short.</p>
<p>Final (funny) quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I joined mid-quarter, the team was drowning in unrealistic commitments. I suggested renegotiating with leadership, but my manager shot it down, worried about optics: &quot;We have to make this work, somehow.&quot;</p>
<p>Then there was Kevin. He&#39;d been with the company since it was tiny and knew the founders personally, and his influence was undeniable. Criticizing him felt like heresy, and not just cross-functional collaboration. Those next-level managers in turn don&#39;t carry that expectation-and-commitment down to taking responsibility for how we show up in the presence of platform services and enabling teams with varying amounts of coordination.</p>
<p>We noted that if anyone observes [ <strong>leading indicators of something harmful or ineffective]</strong> , they should bring that up immediately.</p>
<p>But if I knew that we were committed to tipping local markets as the primary growth lever, even at the cost of others. The latter may not be easier, but it is more honest.</p>
