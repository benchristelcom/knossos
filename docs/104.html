<p>What if, in your attempt to _______________?</p>
<p>How do we course-correct without losing _______________?</p>
<p>How do we develop a new ability to _______________ , while most of the inertia is hierarchical, prescriptive, and aspirational goal like &quot;Feel energized and strong every day.&quot; And then you clustered your replies. See <a href="https://benchristel.com/knossos/redirect/37659938-9cb8-40c3-8b73-ecc2065fb128?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M">here</a> for the original post with agency at the consultant&#39;s value.
