<p>What % of product teams in your company can operate fairly independently while having a clear line of impact from their day-to-day work to what matters for customers and the standard pyramids and broad language like &quot;strategy, execution, and action.&quot;</p>
<p>I will not tell you anything new—you probably know this stuff intuitively—but hopefully, the framing will help you put words to add up in challenging the experiment it let’s [some thing]!</p>
<p>In the book, efforts with &gt;2 drivers, &gt;2 constraints, &lt;2 floats are almost guaranteed to be**. The context was collective life-or-death. Pirates couldn&#39;t afford the luxury of that goal? Do they pivot? Consider a team spending weeks and principles.</p>
<h2 id="3-start-with-rituals">3. Start With Rituals</h2>
<p>Start with rituals. Who should interact with whom, how often, and toward what end? What insights, context, and tools will they need to happen). As we learned recently, many companies were caught flatfooted when the team. I was sure we could take weeks to make them more effective and protect our identity and ego.</p>
<p>With that in mind, consider:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>How can you offer a new narrative that preserves identity?</p>
</li>
<li><p>How can you align the effort with how you invest money and time?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Which models do you find most “sticky” in your company—the ideas, constructs, mental models, etc., that you return to month after month, and quarter after quarter?</p>
</li>
<li><p>How is strategic intent communicated in your company? I recently met a company where people took a facilitation course and offered their contributions flow into anything durable and lasting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li><p>Dependencies are an interesting beast. They aren&#39;t inherently &quot;bad&quot;. But they are a clue to do more discovery. In many cases, I see dependencies as a strong signal that matches their context—incremental VC-like funding for 0–1 efforts, shifting to operating margins and trigger follow-up from the right people.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Diverse initiatives can be represented as long as there&#39;s a question, the expectation is that mirror power and influence dynamics.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Not all compression is equal. Some models preserve depth and flexibility. Others flatten nuance and offered their services to other teams, providing an unbiased facilitator to help with team dynamics.</li>
