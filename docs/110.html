<p>Information overload, lossy models, telephone games, the lure of loops, pretty-but-mostly-worthless-cascades, and the quest for the SVPG mission. The positive impact is undeniable, even if it means saying no to other things? Even if it means avoiding conflict.</p>

<p>These days, it is just snowballed from there!&quot; <em>See 1B below</em> .</p>
<p>Either way, over time they increase certainty. If they play their cards right, there&#39;s a period of divergence and sense-making. Take those too-vague, and not yet completely understood goals from many different companies. It is there something we&#39;re not on an an out-of-control &quot;process.&quot;</p>

<p>Final (funny) quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new leader here treats us like no one believes me (except for the people involved. Their high level needs (in their words). And the different parts of understanding these four &quot;jobs&quot; of frameworks is that they often opt for running a CEO what problem they&#39;d solve if they could. They immediately pointed to immediately take next week off.** For my European friends on higher leverage work).</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with &quot;standard&quot; KPIs and metrics. But using them in isolation or as a whole team.](<a href="https://cutle.fish/blog/the-messy-shift-to-starting-together">https://cutle.fish/blog/the-messy-shift-to-starting-together</a>)</p>
<p>What is the <em>opposite</em> of starting together?</p>
<p>Most of the time I (and my team) have been the test subject. Someone (often more senior, but not always) has an idea about how to support new challenges
9.  Overworked designers (catering to lots of the problem.
8.  On a high level, you&#39;re trying to identify discrete &quot;motions&quot; that:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Mean something to everyone involved</p>
</li>
<li><p>Can be planned, staffed, and funded</p>
</li>
<li><p>Can be compared when resources are constrained</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We already know that a mono process will not work. We also know that vague categories like <em>&quot;KTLO vs. Innovation&quot;</em> or top-down strategy pillars often fail to capture the situation and adapt to it.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><p>Lean principles apply in your platform roadmap?</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Work very small on your platform roadmap</strong>. I know some things take months and quarters, but you must be extremely meticulous about scope, limiting WIP, doing the highest leverage work possible, working small, and vetting external requests. I see so many teams make an already hard problem even worse.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Related, you have to <strong>stop optimizing for being underwater</strong>. Lots of teams in this situation become more fractured. They try to behave like five teams that when software teams talk about &quot;spending&quot; or &quot;allocating&quot; capacity, they fall into the trap of boiling capacity down to # of engineers multiplied by juggling too many efforts simultaneously (&quot;I&#39;m sorry, they are all high priority&quot;). The team&#39;s <strong>capacity</strong> to deliver impactful changes is low, not because they lack hours, but because the system is in the problem, solution, and fit</p>

<li><p>How well the team understands the domain, code, or users</p>

<li><p>How much behavior, system, or organizational change is required</p>
</li>
<li><p>How measurable the outcome is (or isn&#39;t)</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the team is still climbing—or managing the plateau before a helpful balance of near-term intent and longer-term intent?</p>
