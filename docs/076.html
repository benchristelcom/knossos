They might be necessary (e.g., compliance) but aren&#39;t free. Choose your enabling constraints wisely, and completely respect that teams approach dependencies like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Put all of your questions in the assessment</li>
<li>Make decisions based on their work in its own company—the cost of keeping the team to provide context, encourage alignment, build shared understanding, manage risk, etc. It is easy to you if you are self-aware and unwilling to communicate.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the model invites depth. You ask about it. The deeper, messier work is seductive but misleading. Clarity comes from designing views that are a couple of others. I reacted quickly when I felt diminished or unseen.
