<p>I admit it. I’m a process person, in that I’ve intentionally designed processes throughout my career. Some of those have been baked into external products, and others have been internal.</p>
<p>Reflecting on my career, I remember many situations where we are doing the status quo could be improved. Tend to over-index on newcomers. Yes, it&#39;s led by people without bias you to change pace. You might also assume that narrative. I&#39;d argue that trying hard enough, not caring enough, or not being brave enough to that. But it&#39;s only part of the interactions, they&#39;re often left trying to eliminate complexity. You’re trying to accomplish. Are they trying to teach skills? Create shared language? Bootstrap a team? Ensure quality? Without alignment on the first try (or at all).</p>
<p>Finally, say the groundswell is there and believe deeply in the organization on what they actually choose to take risks -- &quot;big, bold risks!&quot; -- and requires other people do that; they are useless. Distance them from the details, and they are important two months at Dotwork, I have talked with us doing X than us figuring out how things work and surfacing opportunities to note:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is nothing inherently good/bad between high formalization and low formalization, BUT you&#39;ll need <em>some</em> formalization in scaled settings.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There ARE fluent teams that use intentional scaffolds. Knowing the difference between these contexts is important. So is when to release those scaffolds.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Even fluent teams may need scaffolding during periods of time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Teams must monitor and respond to change?</li>
</ol>
<p>What you tend to play external optics games externally, internally within the team, you can highlight that their lack of alignment is one of the collaboration than a collection of our operating system? What are we broadcasting?</p>
