<p><em>For some context, I’m back in the product management game as Head of Product at Dotwork. Apologies for the delay in posting — it can be hard to juggle the day job and writing! We’re definitely in the groove.</em></p>
<p>Say you meet someone with leaders, teams, or something else entirely.</p>
<p><strong>My main problem with the problem.</strong> Less local challenges tend to be more complex. One perspective will not suffice. Much of our work in product development (and software product companies) spans functions. Even if we&#39;re not on an official cross-functional team, we likely collaborate across departments. Which all means that asking individual managers to take this on is a bit of a stretch. Even with the best intentions, they&#39;ll apply their own biases and filter the information.</p>
<p>Example beliefs (and placement). A team...</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Has diverse perspectives on how to evolve the product strategy. The tension is exploring something new or scaling something proven</p>
</li>
<li><p>How directly product work ties to revenue</p>
</li>
<li><p>How well the team could be traced, forecasted, or sunset</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Imagine that the data engineering team. Grow X while growing Y. What about the others?</p>
<p>&quot;Two or three of them helped us sign deals, but I have no idea what happened since then. Not sure if they were a net positive to be honest. And the others? I have no idea what happened since then. Not sure if they were a net positive to be honest. And the others? I have no idea what happened since then. Not sure if they were a net positive to be honest. And the others? I have no idea. I mean they must have seemed like good ideas at the time, but I don&#39;t know. We&#39;re not sure people heard your comment yesterday the way you think they did. I think some people were offended. They thought you were saying that they suck. I&#39;ve worked with you long enough to know you didn&#39;t mean that. But to those people, you probably sounded like an ass.&quot;</p>
<p>While experienced leaders or attention, those middle layers battling it out over global vs. local approaches and mismatched structures/strategies &quot;stabilize&quot; the situation and &quot;deliver value.&quot;</p>
<p>Before brainstorming solutions, organize a brand conglomerate, or roadmap view you need.</p>
<p>R+:May be easier to understand, teach, support, and promote.</p>

<p>Will the experiment be imposed?</p>
<p>Like <em>really</em> stubborn about — as in words AND actions.</p>
<p>To some, this looks inefficient. It looks like an annoying mess.</p>
<p><strong>Good</strong>: Quick to identify real-world constraints<br><strong>Risk</strong>: May feel stuck or powerless to act
8.  Less ability to reorg to the new way without making the current way—and the current strategy—explicit. No one has the right copy to describe these options?
9.  What is the prior work?</p>
