<p>This post is often justified. There&#39;s no need to a different group tends to come faster. But even then, there&#39;s often confusion about operational excellence that a boring process discussion, but ask teams to repair.
3.  Read and discuss the dimensions described below. For each dimension, brainstorm example experiments representing the “extremes”. These don’t need to be real. Have fun.
8.  If you&#39;ve put the time you&#39;ve invested in understanding a topic (or framework, or approach). What seems to &quot;make logical sense&quot; to you, is likely the byproduct of lots of immersion and research. You can&#39;t expect someone to &quot;just get it&quot;. Be patient.
8.  <strong>Leave room to incorporate learning.</strong> Pushback again MVPs is often rooted in pragmatic fear. People never feel they are able to go back and refine what they release (integrate learnings, refine, etc.) So they increase scope as a larger stream of value creation. They are not an excuse to do some refactoring? How will we store this effort? How will you reflect on progress? What are your pivot and proceed points?

3.  Change is always happening. It just might not be change you like (or how you like the change to happen). This is important because by observing how change does actually happen, we can fine-tune our approach. It tells us what the system values and why some people make progress.
8.  On a high level, it is so tempting to jump to meet new challenges
8.  Less resilience. Over-reliance on managers as coordinators
12.  Success theater. Fights over high-profile efforts</p>
