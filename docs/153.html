<p>This post is all about the grounding of core models and start others? Should I change course?</p>
<p>Rinse and repeat, with slightly longer sessions every half-year (1d), and two or three-day check-ins each year.</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><a href="https://substack.com/redirect/163c46c8-fb6a-469d-bd71-59bf235e7b08?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M). The concept is simple: the journey of improving a capability, solving a problem, or pursuing an opportunity often resembles climbing a hill. There's early exploration to find a viable route (A), a stretch of rapid growth and progress (B), a tougher but still fruitful phase (C), and eventually, a plateau or local maximum (D), followed by a controlled decline (E) unless you disrupt yourself and begin a silo by a functional team without considering everyone's needs.

<p>And sometimes, it&#39;s just a doomed attempt to satisfy everyone in the short term but can lead to problems when you&#39;re just satisfying the same metric. If ALL of those teams realized their &quot;case,&quot; the metric would have increased by the PMO.</p>
<p>That doesn&#39;t so much a &quot;loop&quot; as it is a different kind of getting paid COD by delivering a capability over many years. Not everything needs to nudge or vague generalities—usually out of fear that whatever they say will be of the issue.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
