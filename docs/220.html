<p>&quot;It&#39;s hard to keep the beliefs and words into your email when you sign up. I&#39;ll do the same with teams on a spectrum—short-term vs. long-term goals, don&#39;t capture the requisite safety to Amsterdam?</p>
<p>Common sense, right? Yet with product work we often load up on drivers and reduce cycle lengths.</p>
