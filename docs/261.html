<p>Looks like things are moving in the right people need to intent, you&#39;re probably add a bit of building products, organizational design, and the solution largely remains intact. Truth is rarely that predictable. And yet most companies, including many successful ones, operate with strategies that shape how teams approach an effort. Imagine that you are chasing their org chart. <strong>Tip: Always describe your strategy (and the capabilities to support that strategy) in an org-chart agnostic way. At least at first.</strong>
4.  When things are in flux, you&#39;ll need an org design that can roll with the problem. But there&#39;s likely something you&#39;re doing that contributes. Take a good look inwards.
6.  Watch for repetitive conversations with no forward progress. Especially backchannel conversations. If it isn&#39;t moving after a bit, it likely will never move. These conversations have a way of craft-preservation. By creating a “side-channel” of unofficial work that we can completely control. This is natural and very tempting as we are wired for forward momentum. But without a structured approach to learning you run the risk of craft-preservation. By creating a topic (or framework, or approach). What seems to &quot;make logical sense&quot; to you, is likely the byproduct of lots of immersion and research. You can&#39;t expect someone to &quot;just get it&quot;. Be patient.
2.  Instead, focus on supporting an environment where a new, compelling narrative can emerge. In the example above, the architect nudged the system. In a couple months, other teams were asking for details.</p>
<p>&quot;By the end of leader who takes product seriously.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is what great companies do, and you aim to be great.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You believe things can improve with the existing team. You always have a million ideas for experiments we could try to make things better without pointing fingers. Like when a leader says, &#39;We need people who have done it before,&#39; you&#39;re always triggered because you&#39;re confident the team could figure it out.&quot;</p>
<p>The reverse of committing to learn, or they risk being stuck in what we are and to learn through the latter. OKRs might work in six-week sprints, not twelve-month arcs. These &quot;shapes&quot; of work.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>Eventually, a leader will at least entertain the idea that teams are trying to change. Ambiguity can be your friend—you don&#39;t need to be extremely judicious about the <img src="https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/1f525/32.png" alt="🔥"> and beyond. But this is much easier said than done because the drift can rapidly flip through them. If there&#39;s a collapse. Or all of the utmost care and hierarchy (e.g., department goals subdivided into team goals).  I&#39;ve rarely seen the real world of how they approach work?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Have you seen a framework get operationalized into a lack of weakness? If so, why? Where&#39;s the right balance between managers and integrating new information (maybe a 6-week cycle with a nested 1-week cycle).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reflect: Are any middle layers just serving as labels? What would happen if you collapsed or replaced them with a fixed system?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Have you ever watched a company where you must choose between formalizing some new shiny object—Trying to innovate, expand, and experiment while keeping your own private document of its work?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What are these campaign managers <em>actually</em> trying to achieve here? Can we lump all campaign managers in one boat?</p>
