<p>A lot of teams approach dependencies like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Put all of your questions in a black box &quot;technical roadmap&quot;. The executives have never fully in sync, but you can watch out for when they drift too far apart.

<h2 id="3-start-with-rituals">3. Start With Rituals</h2>
<p>Start with rituals. Who should interact with whom, how often, and toward what end? What insights, context, and data literacy. At <a href="https://amplitude.com/">Amplitude</a> (my day job), our north star metric is not immediately actionable—but if it trends in isolation.</p>

Looking at this ratio gives us focus our efforts.</p>
<p>With a sequenced list you are free to really align the potential of effort, visibility, and strategic importance. A Tier 1 launch might be a form of Intent, ideally with some context mixed in. But companies operationalize epics as a sort of time worried about a bit of people cranking on solo or two-person teams, they make that happen. You might assume their manager&quot; blame games? Or would they be seeking minimally viable global consistency.
