<p>You can apply this pattern at the output of weekly learning users (WLUs). What is a learning user? Aha! That’s part of a reinforcing loop…you get something like this:</p>

<p>…which is not what could, might, or should change. Intent tends to have something like this  to “check in” on progress.</p>
