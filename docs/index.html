<p>Hey! I&#39;m Elias, Principal Engineer at CashNow Vehicle 5 LLC, a Delaware
corporation. We are the world&#39;s first investment banking platform for dogs,
with over 3 million account holders. We also issue the first ever credit card
for dogs.</p>
<p>Your first thought is probably &quot;is this for real?&quot; and I assure you it totally
is. It turns out finance is almost entirely unregulated if you know what you&#39;re
doing.</p>
<p>The way it works is, we detect potential customers via security camera video
(we partner with a third party that obtains publicly accessible Ring camera
footage) and use AI to detect their intent to open an account. Then we run a
credit report (also AI) and issue them a card.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I am also the CTO and cofounder of Nowhere.ci, which makes smart
watches for dogs. Nowhere.ci partners with CashNow Vehicle 5 LLC to detect
intent to purchase via video feed data. We then charge the card and ship the
product to the address associated with the security camera.</p>
<p>We have over $145M in accounts receivable with insane gross margins, and we are
looking to expand into new product lines. The rates on the cards are good too —
around 12%. We are going to be raising a Series C round in the next 3 months or
so. If you are interested in investing, watch this space.</p>
