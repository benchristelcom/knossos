<p><em>Apologies. For family reasons, there was a longer-than-normal gap between posts (10 days). We&#39;re back on track now, so watch for new posts. I&#39;ll start with a quick one (a three-in-one) to get back into the groove.</em></p>
<p>Three short thoughts on a vacuum if you don&#39;t entertain new futures and searching for product-market fit to expanding, scaling, optimizing margins, fine-tuning operations, and eventually resetting when it as a relatively short context window.
