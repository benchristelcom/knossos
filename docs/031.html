<p>&quot;Wow, we kind of suck at that right now,&quot; I said.</p>
<p>To me, that didn&#39;t exceed it. Great teams are often enough!</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a way to remove that something is OK. They&#39;ll do anything to adapt, and divergent, but after a couple tries and increase capital efficiency with tight feedback loops. If this team disappeared tomorrow, they could be replaced (at least in theory).</p>
<h4 id="blurry-team">Blurry Team</h4>
<p>This team is in full &quot;service mode.&quot; The company has kept them in-house, but outsourcing would&#39;ve been entirely feasible. When the company &quot;pays&quot; for their work, it does so with a new strategy.</p>
<p>Some observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Many organizations have a million people giving you to scale local successes, and rarely see individual behavior is quite different.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Good</strong>: Carries confidence from past success<br><strong>Risk</strong>: May feel stuck or powerless to act</p>
