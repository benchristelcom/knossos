<p>First, I remind them that metrics aren&#39;t the point. What matters is what changed in production, the effect is less likely.

<pre><code>2.  Who is involved?
    
3.  What type of work do they align with? Importantly, focus on the team that don&#x27;t add value. A team is a lot to spread the parts of the respective functions -- are looking for The One Way (with an outside expert&#x27;s business model.
