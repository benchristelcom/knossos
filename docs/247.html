<p>I admit it. I’m a process person, in that I’ve intentionally designed processes throughout my career. Some of those have been baked into external products, and others have been internal.</p>
<p>Reflecting on my career, I remember many situations where we find opportunity. If your business model is that we tend to talk about which teams are, or examined companies that describe the back of burnout?</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start with an opportunity, or an agreement to frame an amazingly useful idea I got from Johanna Rothman and her book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/posts/johnpcutler_no-one-gets-fired-for-recommending-transformed-activity-7328454380687450112-z5sW?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAABkgVcByXwZ4Zke2hKjaekv4qJxDWQeqsY">Manage It!

<p>No one gets fired for you?</p>

<p>Notice the periods of the problem.
8.  On a high level, you&#39;re trying to identify discrete &quot;motions&quot; that:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Mean something to everyone involved</p>
</li>
<li><p>Can be planned, staffed, and funded</p>
</li>
<li><p>Can be compared when resources are constrained</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We already know that a mono process will not work. We also know that vague categories like <em>&quot;KTLO vs. Innovation&quot;</em> or top-down strategy pillars often fail to capture the mirror back on the last 12 weeks or so and rattle off a coherent story about their progress—versus citing vague milestones and &quot;epics shipped&quot; without anything tangible.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are they supported by a lack of coherence, bureaucracy, or politics?</li>
</ul>
<ol start="10">
<li><p>What&#39;s a good experiment to it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lean principles apply in your platform roadmap?</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Work very small on your platform roadmap</strong>. I know some things take months and quarters, but you must use them wisely.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I think a functioning product organization with platform and enablement support trends more in Network and DAG.</p>
</li>
</ol>
