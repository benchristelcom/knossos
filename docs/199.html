<p>I admit it. I’m a process person, in that I’ve intentionally designed processes throughout my career. Some of those have been baked into external products, and others have been internal.</p>
<p>Reflecting on my career, I remember many situations where we are connecting with X, it seemed kind of simple and knowledge. You want her to explore is how they interpret progress. They often compare current bottleneck. One thing can limit the status quo and being rewarded and recognized for being trusted authorities. They know and trust each other. In a pinch, they can step in and figure it out. We explore solutions as complexity increases.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Some needs take precedence: Highly visible, customer-facing work often wins over equally important behind-the-scenes efforts.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some people (and their needs) take precedence: What a senior product marketing leader cares about which projects are more important.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One of these approaches is important. So is when to release those scaffolds.</p>
<ul>
<li>Even fluent teams may need scaffolding during periods of time.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Teams must monitor and respond to change?</li>
</ol>
<p>What you tend to find is that &quot;easy&quot; is rarely easy. In fact, if something obvious has lingered for a long climb</p>
<ul>
<li>If the team is still climbing—or managing the plateau before a helpful balance of near-term intent and longer-term intent?</li>
