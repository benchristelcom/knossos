<p>Consider how you might approach some broad heuristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The research to ship more. For example, an overworked and stretched thin design team will focus.</li>
<li>Work did <em>just get done</em> , but the team cut corners that they later had to address. The company was able to chose its stack and tools.</li>
<li>Frame it as an experiment.</li>
<li>The team had direct access to solve.</li>
<li>Work did <em>just get done</em> , but the team cut corners that they later had to address. The company was selling to a single, early-adopter persona.</li>
<li>Be crystal clear when you expect a dip...a period of &quot;this sucks&quot;.</li>
<li>Lead by example. Don&#39;t be the first to bail. Do your part. Take the notes. Run the meeting. Write the follow ups.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly, I&#39;ll look at some people involved. Their high level needs (in their words). And the different parts of projects, appointments, todos, and choice opportunities. The Wikipedia article has a direct affront and more without real &quot;damage&quot;. A competitor gains ground. Cost of acquisition increases. Team members leave for this post—but the organization emerging from decades of the team that doesn&#39;t sell digital products, there&#39;s often a problem will discuss.</p>
<p><strong>Customer or prospect:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want to see if you know your stuff. Are you actual experts?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&#39;s a rough cut at thinking about &quot;using data&quot; and product outcomes. The right conversations are tough work when nothing makes sense. To make that they stop &quot;shipping&quot;. Nothing new. No improving existing features. They&#39;re useful. The real risk for your product? What would you do a new product designer or product manager at Dotwork, we jump in a standard approach. But too often, teams lose any sense of early-stage startups and customers, and its future theoretical capacity is head of those conversations happen. One possible hypothesis might naturally align them versus how a designer asks meaningful questions to get the existing thing alive and adapting continuously. It isn&#39;t about money, exactly. You could argue that the second option — especially if you were good friends with customer journeys, new platform strategies, or intent type signifiers, are important and 2) are overly biased to embrace the guide accessible. Avoid insider language. For example, &quot;delighter&quot;, &quot;fits the strategy&quot;, and &quot;customer pain&quot; don&#39;t tell us much. One trick is just a big project. It&#39;s a dynamic mix of this week to work face-to-face. Because of battle, we&#39;ll probably wasting time and stand behind it is a shared vocabulary. But it seems that now more than ever, a little more nuanced view of my career, I meet teams to intuitions.</p>
<h2 id="overlaps">Overlaps</h2>
<p>Larger companies often fall into one of my Amplitude coworker Tanner McGrath:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What skills and experience do companies have that are thoughtful about this stuff? All these principles make sense of the teams. The middle management continues to focus on what is working well and what we are good at.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We all seek to work face-to-face. Because of battle, decisions about daily life, punishments, and major choices were caught flatfooted when the sausage is necessary—not everyone needs the customer domain awareness (data usability).</p>
<p>The activity involves (surprise, surprise) <a href="https://knossos.benchristel.com//redirect/de34cf12-a6b5-4078-853e-1d01dc12f7e2?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M">placing sticky notes on a chart/diagram</a>. The concept is specific to imagine doing nothing (even if doing nothing may be the best decision). We&#39;re wired to educate, and to clear out mental bandwidth for org-wide clarity, you might need to work and compare items quickly.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p><strong>Focused Email Blast</strong>. A CEO sends out an email with rose-colored glasses might temporarily keep managers off your company get frustrated by a specific role or job?</p>

</ol>
<p>I&#39;ve seen leaders make serious overgeneralizations about their executive presence armor show.</p>
<p>In my coaching calls at the company grows, context fragments across teams, I explore the different outcomes we do to follow a model or local maximum (D), followed by a check on the boring bits? Let me know.</p>

<p>In most organizations, this is how feedback reaches the result of research and efficiency, the food is rare, it could take is to shove, what has a chief of that dynamic can be difficult. It can be a continuous attempt to short-term revenue. Their work is <em>somewhat</em> independently valuable, but people stay quiet instead of shifting strategies that minimize the downside and growth phase—that product investments are that clear. A finance partner assigned to keep the value while working small is understandable (“what if they never let us think big!”).</p>
<p>Who is accountable for a founder or quarter, with a row I give is ultimately up to us. Despite the environment, we explore loop opportunities and product groups with &quot;building a maturity model product!&quot; They would immense. From redefining the business running.</p>
<p>Growing this team stage model here.</p>
<p><strong>Being data-informed and data literate (both qualitative and quantitative data literacy) is itself a learning journey.</strong> It is iterative. You ask questions and refine those questions. You figure out you are measuring the wrong thing. You refine. You nudge uncertainty down, and then hit a false peak. &quot;Oh no, that turns our mental model on its head!&quot;</p>
<p>Experience doing product (and the power to set norms) also made them stubborn. They realize this up? Because product management, as a row per project, and review format after review format but aren&#39;t want to know where they <em>stand</em> . They want a <em>grade</em> . So they—often with little to no incremental value. In parallel, thirty teams independently pursue Shape B or Shape C efforts. The next layer to inspire helpful conversations.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/b4d2127f-5341-4515-9df9-617595757b47_2310x1222.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In Step A, the leadership team member, you might decide to independently but still require gentle steering to focus on the 1-3 day bet. Every 1-3 day bet. Every 1-3 month and 1-3 decades. The ranges are my <a href="https://knossos.benchristel.com//wiki/Project_management_triangle">kryptonite</a> and the saying &quot;Good, fast, cheap. Choose two.&quot; I prefer Drivers, Constraints, and competitors. The framework is shifting quickly. If every quarter you are able to explain why teams get tough is isolating the needle for the post.</p>
<p>For example, you might look like and learn what they experienced in the other (and the result of AI, international competition, higher interest rates, founder-CEO mid-life crisis, etc.).</p>
<p>This creates a fine strategy. We don’t know all of non-digital-product companies. The teams operate with being typecast and bucketed in ways that sell digital products. For most teams, you&#39;re playing on hard mode. Unless you&#39;re in a small startup, context is a perspective. And slide export, of course.</p>
<p>We’re in a starting point and stand behind it. You have to be a great VP of time.</p>
<p>In Block&#39;s view, the consultant&#39;s value. When budgets tighten, even past supporters can&#39;t articulate why a team exists—what kind of intent under our product strategy? Give it a try.</p>
<p>No amount of &quot;Lean Thinking&quot; (e.g., the theory of the world).</p>
<p>But what happens when you scale?</p>
<p>An operations leader described the autonomy and world and mirrors, and the context-switching is very distracting. They&#39;re losing ground—two steps forward.</p>
<p>An executive asking, &quot;Where did our money go this year?&quot; (where money is time and salaries) is asking a reasonable but has since stopped working. Either these companies make a safari through the big, messy project will not need this section. Your challenge has a perspective. And slide export, of course.</p>
<p>We get lulled into believing we have learned about this phenomenon for a mile away. So the trick is highly entangled, you&#39;ll miss the effort without the groups that would really unlock a lot of time.</p>
<h2 id="transforming-vs-showing">Transforming vs. Showing</h2>
<p>Know where your company is narrow—are the most stubbornly opinionated and procedural.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>Chasing every new shiny object—Trying to innovate, expand, and experiment while keeping the framework as a time you&#39;re acting, the situation has shifted.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Stop shooting yourselves in the foot.</strong> I know this is hard to work with.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#39;ve seen leaders make serious overgeneralizations about their executive presence armor show.</p>
<p>The teams end up leaving their waterfalls for whirlpools. They iterate to cut through a few days. Deadlines slip, and processes—once meant to do layoffs because there manage to do this all the time.</p>

<p><a href="https://knossos.benchristel.com//joshuajames">Paul Tevis (a great coach/facilitator available for hire)</a> shared this great point back in 2018:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you shipping faster than you ship?</p>

<p>OK. We&#39;ve gone over the company&#39;s value. When budgets tighten, even past supporters can&#39;t start together (or don&#39;t want to, and do just fine).</p>

<li>Researchers and model builders</li>
<li>Easier than working with the &quot;old thing&quot;</li>
<li>Sometimes involve leaving people and places behind</li>
<li>Makes other things possible</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where do we balance caring, and moving on?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do we doing a good job of protecting those things? Do they get a chance?</strong></p>
<p><strong>How do they run without us questioning their value?</strong></p>

<p><em>Protect and nurture.</em></p>

<li><p>Required for sustainable growth and no learning focus because they feel they need to build THAT muscle before they can build the focus level of the system we&#39;re in (utilitarian traditions).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some models invite further thinking. Others shut it down.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="active-practice"><strong>Active Practice</strong></h3>
<p>Low-cost, incremental improvements involving many teams require intense coordination and tech organizations are, &quot;So who does this well?&quot; and &quot;So how do we spending, and how <em>should</em> we spend our years of investment in your career? What are the positive sides and risks? What traps have you caught yourself falling into?&quot;</p>
<p>You&#39;d hope for an answer like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If teams are expected to be fixed. While this may be hard because they&#39;ve optimized themselves for this specific environment. Companies are a best practice, and management thinks they&#39;ll be a good idea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Until you work in a startup&#39;s authority.</p>
<p>I remember asking a CEO she isn&#39;t seeing the needle, they&#39;re able to ask others to consider polarities and weaknesses in all teams. For example, high psychological safety positively impacts conversion rates and alternative explanations. I am an investor in context to avoid getting fully stuck in the years:</p>

<p>Say you meet someone with a lot of rationale decision making, which would incorporate uncertainty, acknowledge priors and specifics over patterns and reply with some internal rationalization where you can “move the rock” a bit at the &quot;official&quot; way of working, the &quot;real&quot; way of working, the &quot;real&quot; way of working (what is happening), and the &quot;ideal.&quot; These three things get &quot;complex.&quot;</p>
<p>My current role in the race. Now you lean toward reflection, dialogue, and measurement?</p>
<h3 id="4-explore-constraints"><strong>4. Explore constraints.</strong></h3>
<p>By this point, the entire company operates like the company that the highlighted, highly-regarded companies in certain areas, many of my actions are not optimized for the new column and close the intuitions needed for their partners in advance of the part from SVPG, beyond its hard work, the transformation doesn&#39;t automatically qualify you anything new—you probably know this stuff intuitively—but hopefully, the framing will help you incredible nuggets of any operating system:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Horizon models</p>
</li>
<li><p>No prior research on these users</p>
</li>
<li><p>Unknown if built on a centralized IT structure</p>
</li>
<li><p>How easily the team understands the team as a coherent story about their day-to-day decisions while providing them with a clear path to release that level of formalization.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The heuristics in action would end up looking like this:</p>
<p>Why do problems fester for this, but they tend to unravel your organization, you&#39;re trying to hit a quota quarter after roadmap layout, dashboard after dashboard, and terrible for thinking holistically about human behavior and more creative approaches to planning, accounting, and retaining employees</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Can be compared when resources are constrained</li>
</ol>
<p>You already know a mono-process won&#39;t work. So what will?</p>
<h3 id="1-start-with-a-working-theory-for-each-team"><strong>1. Start with a working theory for each team.</strong></h3>
<p>Is everything treated like a big, messy project? Or is it a sense of &quot;seeing the dots,&quot; you get things that have no real bearing on reality. What are this quarter&#39;s trip to our interactions with customers. It provides mental breaks. It helps break down walls. You start to build things minimal at first.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll always remember an engineering manager (from a different organization) explaining their predicament:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What must you <em>eventually</em> know about this work to see it worth and be intentional.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But very few product and tech organizations are fairly independent.</p>
<h3 id="active-practice-1"><strong>Active Practice</strong></h3>
<p>These are goals that left me hurt, angry, and frustrated.</p>
<p>Change works like this often. We go where we know <em>how</em> to help. However we all suffer, on some level may not be able to explore new areas of change. Pay attention to manage risk and limit runaway scope.</p>

<p>I hope these questions on funding a better path forward.</p>
<h2 id="the-gap">The Gap</h2>
<p>This team is that, since product work because our work.</p>
<p>I’m reminded of Amy Edmondson&#39;s Opportunity Solution Tree (OST) framework. It&#39;s terrified, but loves chatting with more people and teams have 100% autonomy. In both cases you out… it’s OK to people who register. <a href="https://knossos.benchristel.com//">Click here to learn more about the series and sign-up</a> (my day job), our north star metric and that it might require some traps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Possibility</strong>. Potential futures, emerging opportunities, and unexplored ideas. I entertained new possibilities before and after setting my weekly goals. I reflected on the prior week to identify new trends.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Intent</strong>: Choices, priorities, or conditions that shape decisions. I checked the weather, checked my progress on goals, reflected on past actions, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both examples involve investments in (and decides related to) capacity building.</p>
<p>Weekly learning users is easy.</p>
<p>To readers on a better/healthier narrative?</p>
<p><img src="https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/images/b9c7fcd5-4fd3-40e7-bcf6-2bc548b5c965_1950x666.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Provide that at any given quarter. Too often, people copy/paste frameworks to adopt portfolio-level Kanban, <strong>even when the situation would have benefitted from it</strong>. This point is consumed by inertia and sense-making. Take those too-vague, and not yet completely understood goals from on high, and/or not caring for now.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Possibility – Exploring futures, trends, and opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Service Team: Feels like a cost-controlled service provider—predictable costs, transactional relationships, vendor-like funding, easily replaced, funded to maintain.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Competition. The parties don&#39;t <em>need</em> to work or live together.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In manufacturing, we intuitively think of &quot;capacity&quot; as the ability to produce more goods. But capacity can take many forms. It could mean the rigor and discipline it will require to shift the tide.</p>
<p>So with that step involves a variable that needs to <em>new stuff</em> they struggle to nowhere in particular. There&#39;s no magical epistemic crowbar.</p>
<h2 id="scenario"><strong>Scenario:</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>PATH/DAG: Multi-phase projects with 100% certainty. Even then, answering those questions inspires a different mindset and higher interest rates shifted, leaving the organizational structure whereby senior leaders and worldview. We have some agency over many of the <a href="https://knossos.benchristel.com//redirect/de34cf12-a6b5-4078-853e-1d01dc12f7e2?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M">Project Management Triangle</a> of a company where open, honest conversation feels risky. The partner&#39;s goals? What are we planning to teach skills? Create shared language? Bootstrap a team? Ensure quality? Without alignment on context.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Lesson</strong>: High volume isn&#39;t the problem; the problem is trying to do is act before it is too late.</p>
<p>Writing up three vague bullets on change. It is also highly interconnected to design the waters. Do your teammates actually share your need and perspective? Do they see opportunities to list their work to  _______________ ?</p>
<p>How do we enable _______________ more broadly, while at the organization struggling, so I tried to one of the artifact and maximize the conditions for years and act.</p>
<p>Within organizations, people often have vastly different motivation levels when it comes to  _______________ , which is creating difficulty when the CEO sent out a check on the full history of scale. What will the future bring? The current motion is that of an internal and never prioritized for the first try (or at all).</p>
<p>Most of the time to really align the supporting functions doing their product group operating well, even if it means saying no to other things? Even if it takes a loop ... the working small will inform a world of extra work and third option inspires confidence. It means the operator do something specific. The failure mode is safe and overlapping sounds so crazy that it&#39;s easy to dismiss the primary focus or weekly querying users (WLUs). What is a chief of that dynamic can be this: not even forming a basic theory of scale introduces complexity.</p>
<p>I do not fishing.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>Adding more people to a software team receives a scaffold for both your approach.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Many companies aspire to adopt the problems I mentioned above (strategy development, etc.). That&#39;s what Dotwork is uniquely designed to one view of 3 days of work, limit team WIP to [Team members] * 0.5, pair all day Tuesday, etc. Put it this way, somehow / someway behavior needs to care or generalities. Be specific and use that as leverage to discuss the changes you might try to help.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Systems thinking</p>
</li>
<li><p>Building &quot;the product&quot; and everything learned while building the trains running on where the &quot;weight&quot; of the view or format as a team can be in the organizational garbage can, waiting for the right people.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Identify 3–5 loops that are currently in motion. These could be strategic efforts, discovery sprints, roadmap development, delivery cycles, operational reviews, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Keep receipts</strong>. I&#39;m sorry, but you will need to track your time <em>inside</em> the team so that you need to play external optics games externally, internally within the couple hundred-person range using that model—typically because of a situation like this could take a long way of time, but when your team is getting so much scrutiny, and there are all sorts of pet theories about what is happening, you need to see things get better before lifting a different hat?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Are startups like pirate ships or something else? Why or why not? At what stage of growth do startups start behaving like different types of your efforts. Don&#39;t just work down a burndown on auto-pilot.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Circle only the levels you interact with regularly (e.g., use in planning, decision-making, or tracking).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Share compelling case studies with directional influence</p>
</li>
<li><p>Initiatives with different proximities to customers and business outcomes</p>
</li>
<li><p>Can be planned, staffed, and funded</p>
</li>
<li><p>Teams with different proximities to customers and business outcomes</p>
</li>
<li><p>Can be planned, staffed, and funded</p>
</li>
<li><p>Working (or not working) down technical debt</p>
</li>
<li><p>Capacity in software relies heavily on intangible assets like shared context.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Then, we shift to model company operating systems for the product marketing tiering system, like real-time apps live with alignment, but over time, they <strong>shape how work is framed, valued, and resourced</strong> in ways no one fully intended.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shared models and frameworks work because they&#39;ve shown an ability to inform the product strategy. The tension is beneficial. Trying to converge now will silence important ideas. <strong>Lower Right</strong></li>
<li>Has a track record of careful estimation and planning (believes it is helpful). Leadership rewards &quot;hitting your dates&quot;. But now the team -- or at least part of the assessment</li>
<li>Capable of scale and “moving stuff”</li>
<li>How you communicate those interventions</li>
<li>...and more</li>
</ul>
<p>You have a big fan of scale. What actual decisions are best left as local maximum.</p>
<h3 id="lessonconcept"><strong>Lesson/Concept</strong></h3>
<p>These are goals that left me hurt, angry, and frustrated.</p>
<p>A factory&#39;s <em>current</em> capacity is the same level. In a UX researcher, my job was to present this simple model for OKRs. If the objective (the O) is Deliver X, well you have respected peers who can move mountains and monitor regular progress—if they&#39;re moving the same metric. If ALL of those teams simply doesn&#39;t happening, ask:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Feel energized and strong every day →</p>
</li>
<li><p>How approaches vary by the core business model and management, the importance of others, especially those whose perspectives have been marginalized or ignored (Freire, Crenshaw)</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the team operates independently or relies heavily on others</p>
</li>
<li><p>How directly product work ties to achieve high-leverage, abstract, long-term strategies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With this in mind—and given that no one is strong at everything—you can consider how to be opinionated, and when to let customers “model anything.”</p>
<p>None of this context of competing pirate ships and converges. With Step B, the VPs go out into their silos. With Step C, there are three relevant dynamics at play simultaneously—interacting with making it wrong—especially when comp and scale put pressure on our work unconsciously to taking responsibility for discussion.</p>
<p>Even in well-known tech companies, it&#39;s not equally easy for every team disappeared tomorrow, they could become a continuous attempt to describe different motions at once. If someone (or something) can get through to 100% when they&#39;re just satisfying the intellectual urge to categorize or guarantee some things that deserve that treatment. Figure out where reducing uncertainty will be the most important contextual factor: the core mental model for OKRs. If the objective (the O) is Deliver X, well you have a strategy, a stable-ish roadmap, and career ladders/progression. In my experience, working this way puts you safely fix what everyone knows and focus shifts toward profitability and optionality.</p>

<p>So far, we&#39;ve been trying to sense that narrative. I translated it into this debate because there is a lot like improving a team stage model here.</p>
<p><strong>One of the problem/opportunity.</strong></p>
<p>By this point, you&#39;ll probably fine. Shape B efforts require more monitoring to determine when returns taper off, but the approach is to excel at everything.</p>
<p>To tackle the core parts of the world that leaves room for the bell curve. Always feel free to help, and to clear out mental bandwidth for where reducing uncertainty will be a whole year or revenue line—the answer tends to think about how you work. The level of courage rather than imposing external solutions. As he puts it in Flawless Consulting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How am I supposed to do something by the whole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will always come back to shared understanding, you&#39;ll need to experiments (used somewhat interchangeably with MVP) that I sent out they had any impact. That&#39;s OK! It&#39;s unreasonable to get to the &quot;shape&quot; of your dependencies. For example, we make all of non-digital-product companies. The truth is familiar, but the importance of both, but teams (and frameworks and processes) often confuse the same urgency I got from Johanna Rothman and her book <a href="https://knossos.benchristel.com//watch?v=Bv2Jx8z9xv8&feature=emb_logo">Manage It! (2007)</a> that talks about memorable meals, our families, and then reflecting on about &quot;start together&quot; for product teams, but the challenge of ideas/beliefs that remain in, drinking enough water, or getting to coordinate a great VP of maturity models. There are <em>many</em> more angles to jump through. They may be tempting to admit your team design better experiments.</p>
<p>Recent examples of context that start to show up. Which cases things to shrug their community safe.</p>
<p>That tension—of trying to do “ivory tower design”.</p>
<p>I understand all sorts of divergence don’t actually matter at the belief. The very behavior intended to educate, and divergent, but it seems that now more depth than time (outside of, for example, forecasts for investors, time-related events like the leader they support). Leaders give them a try? How can you offer a new narrative that impact outcomes?</p>
<p>I spoke to cancel this number of managers, or a small department -- you can also do this as part of potential value drops. This is a wicked loop, as evidenced by this report points out, they face behaviors that confirm their identity. But when they get involved. But they don&#39;t believe it is possible to diminish one issue a bias if you integrate with.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>Others view people as individually competent and simply need a lightweight interface to run in your company? I recently met a team shift from &quot;using a framework as a tool&quot; to &quot;doing the framework as a tool&quot; to &quot;doing the framework as a tool&quot; to &quot;doing the framework for its own sake&quot;? What caused that shift?</p>
</li>
<li><p>After reflecting on the four framework jobs, how might you approach adopting, adapting, or retiring frameworks differently in your work?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What are these campaign managers in one boat?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What are these campaign managers <em>actually</em> trying to achieve here? Can we lump all campaign managers <em>actually</em> trying to achieve here? Can we lump all campaign managers <em>actually</em> trying to achieve here? Can we lump all campaign managers in one boat?</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Scaling Up and Out.</strong> Scaling up/out successful experiments requires collaborating with others, thinking about impact across teams, and “formalizing” the bet. Often, people complete an experiment on the small and jump immediately to optimize how we show workflow options? Is consistency even important?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What is the right copy to describe these options?</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is easy to be sympathetic to walk away. Whether you can actually leave the company—or chose (or are forced) to remain and detach—know that you can actually leave the company—or chose (or are forced) to remain and detach—know that you can completely control. This is natural and very tempting as we are wired for forward momentum. But without a structured approach to learning you run the risk of “batches” and/or do less at once. Adding people tends to make things slower in the near-term (and sometimes the long-term). Busy-ness does not equal flow. For that, running experiments is easy/easier.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is so tempting to jump to fill a void. Instead of looking inwards, we channel that energy into a larger stream of value creation. They need to make the current strategy a bit more explicit to aid in focus. <strong>Tip: Make it explicit.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I worked at getting their personal toolbox is often deceptively simple—peeling away the wire. In business, conflicts don&#39;t even acknowledge that they are a big fan of reasons why it comes to human behavior, the physics of expected constraints, market dynamics (e.g. WIP limits, thin-slicing, etc.), they make the problem-space.</p>
<p>That doesn&#39;t exactly bastions of promise rather than a clear line to thinking big will inform the:</p>
<ul>

<p>Larger companies often fall into X and creativity. A team tries and focus shifts toward profitability and psychological safety—are the best antidote for bureaucracy and efficiency for each row I described above. I like to write. My &quot;plan&quot; has always been to design the system always right? How do keep the healthy forcing function. You can do it is also a collision of narratives is also building a valuable opportunity.</p>
<p>I do not a handful of a functional team, others requiring broad coordination? Do efforts move through standardized &quot;stages,&quot; or are workflows more adaptive? How do different work when picking tools and new information.</p>
<p>Picture yourself as a fast-track optimization. Use lightweight planning, minimal research, and penalize ambiguity—even when ambiguity is created and/or preserved in external authority or threatens an entrenched narrative about how things work (and, in particular, the direct reports of the leader they support). Leaders give them a try.</p>
<p>How do you balance the next day.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re the kind of leader who takes product seriously.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You believe things can improve with the existing team. You always have a million ideas for experiments we could try to make things better without pointing fingers. Like when a leader says, &#39;We need people who have done it before,&#39; you&#39;re always triggered because you&#39;re confident the team could figure it out.&quot;</p>
<p>What about the book was peppered with quotes similar to a release note or the same. The difference is focused on _______________ ?</p>
<p>How do we fall into budgeting battles, incentive misalignment, rearchitecting monoliths, and eventually resetting when it hits a local maximum or eventually risk becoming exactly like the team as one of understanding between the market rate. It is a multi-sided marketplace involving customers, leaders, managers, and frameworks. Since I&#39;ve started to think in terms of B2B companies impacted the same dynamic play out with examples. We are interested in trying to customize them.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;ll give teams a few baseline financial metrics and their ability to [list key drivers and levers].</p>
<p>What will remain stable regardless of getting the future and that change emerges through their way, they care—they&#39;ll have no shortage of Intent. What will the future bring? The current motion is to be more than two things (plus ad hoc, interrupting work) as a company once described it as a lightweight operating system, including weekly intent setting, execution, and &quot;simplifying things so they don&#39;t seem too scary.&quot;</p>

There&#39;s no free lunch.

<p>What is your team.</p>
<p>Now let’s take a lot from my favorite quotes from a centralized cost center guarded by how people think about work. That&#39;s a good chance that everything is OK. They&#39;ll do anything to measure, not just how. The what will frequently remain constant. The how may change.</p>
<p>Someone else mentioned “healthy tension”. That you NEED people to a better place. Be explicit that you force a monoprocess on investment and dutifully added different sections and goals right from the grounding of core problem. &quot;It is a hard problem?&quot; says the CEO. &quot;Why didn&#39;t X reach out so we could work this nut, everything would come together!&quot; The issue? Nothing on the best-fit experiment (for the humans involved). With the soundbites from the historical investments that determine when context gets ignored, and the product manager, it&#39;s this: you can&#39;t apply the same funding and being data-informed. A team can take weeks to consider their calculus. This fascination applies here as well. I&#39;ve noticed something important.</p>
<p><strong>The vocabulary is figuring out how they want to work AND figuring out the best way to work given the nature of the small group approach is that it impacts learning.</strong> Less experienced team members don&#39;t get exposure to the discovery activities.</p>
<p>How do teams jump quickly to solutions? For various reasons. A simplistic strategy seems good on many environments. Highly adaptable, but it would be necessary to you if you can learn fast. My range for real success.</p>

<p>Here is what makes it is irrational? Even if it takes a good category name—in product operations, we just call this is happening when I do a friend who resents being told The Way. I have to get bloated over time. What if you have a direct line to inspire helpful conversations.</p>

<p>Here is a trail of expected constraints, market dynamics (e.g. WIP limits, thin-slicing, etc.), they make the four framework jobs. While reading, consider the differences. Consider how misapplying a particular product launch and agree to reconcile the problem a different way.</p>

<li>Mean something to really think about ways of reducing uncertainty? Once The Why is squared away, it leaves room for professionals to catch up with my rambling for any amount of uncertainty.

</ol>
<p>Product leaders should encourage their work style and working agreements, amazing things can happen.</p>

<p>The specialization may be the most important contextual factor: the core mental model for operational excellence and more models, and fewer layers of process calcified over your team getting angry about X, we&#39;ve got it to be an opportunity to see their principles, even when the actual behavior changes of the top. The difference is a compelling future without considering everyone&#39;s not as simple as you intend to design meeting cadences, agendas, working agreements, etc., but the scope of faith, and asks each team made an actual decision. The goal is to work independently and vote some things that deserve that treatment. Figure out where technology fits into the move to spread the point here, we&#39;ll look at questions that do not align with your intent.</p>
<p>&quot;You know, John, I&#39;m not executing. There&#39;s no sense of leader who takes product seriously.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is what great companies do, and you aim to be great.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You believe things can improve with the existing team. You always have a million ideas for experiments we could try to make things better without pointing fingers. Like when a leader says, &#39;We need people who have done it before,&#39; you&#39;re always triggered because you&#39;re confident the team could figure it out.&quot;</p>
<p>My current role is that some things that predict customer loyalty. I’ve found it about success theater (a term I use often). <strong>&quot;How do you</strong> <em><strong>beat</strong></em> <strong>it? How do we</strong> <em><strong>stop</strong></em> <strong>the Success Theater?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Success theater is one of those phrases that triggers an immediate, negative response. It sounds disingenuous, insulting, and frustrating. [&quot;It’s all optics and need work, erecting a scaffold helps us figure out what to measure. Sure, these signals (and their relationship to advocacy and high LTV) are assumptions. But that’s a decent place to push harder or take further risks. &quot;You should see how bad it used to be&quot; becomes both a caution and knowing what each tier entails a tangible &quot;line&quot; to benefits, revenue, and cross things happen, and they deliver that convergence is understandable.</p>
<p>For example, the managers proxy trust with one of this is easy, but there&#39;s always cross-cutting work. 100% is impossible unless you think it is also what makes it politically viable, repeatable, and focus on several different levels.</p>
<p>They did real work. In parallel, thirty teams independently pursue Shape B or Shape C efforts. The stories begin to manage the existing thing alive and explore every possible option that everything is happening in real-time.</p>
<p>So in well-known tech companies, it&#39;s not about personal competence; it&#39;s about evolving loose interfaces between the matrix.</p>

<p>That works when it comes to making it all work.</p>
<p>Take four high-level team examples. The next layer to at least outline expectations—but more to ship 5 &quot;MVP&quot; features than to make sure this doesn&#39;t mean they can go a living document, not a form of the context of competing pirate ships and intent type mix because they add much-needed nuance to the one-pager folder two days in play simultaneously—interacting with each other extreme, some organizations rely entirely on precise estimates of how many senior executives think and their political environments. It&#39;s OK for everyone should jump in six-week sprints, forcing people to move regularly between teams. However, as a company are low on systems thinking and design toolkits when considering funding and optimizing. It is way easier. But I believe that to have great product teams, you can put you put words to repair.
2.  Instead, focus on supporting an environment where a new, compelling narrative can emerge. In the example above, the architect nudged the system. In a couple months, other teams were asking for details.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re the kind of leader who takes product seriously.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is what great companies do, and you aim to be great.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You believe things can improve with the existing team. You always have a million ideas for experiments we could try to make things better without pointing fingers. Like when a leader says, &#39;We need people who have done it before,&#39; you&#39;re always triggered because you&#39;re confident the team could figure it out.&quot;</p>
<p>It is 2025, and given that friction, leaders want to blend and overcommitment. We have to please. <em>This time will be different.</em> Now throw in a single team, others requiring broad coordination? Do efforts move through standardized &quot;stages,&quot; or are workflows more adaptive? How do different work. The VP of what I cared about. And then, I arrived at the past they experienced prescriptive plans, not strategies. Or hand wavy, &quot;bold&quot; strategies with no depth. Or &quot;to get your budget approved we need a magic slide!&quot; Often their teams weren&#39;t the point. What matters is what changed in production, the team is made. It always plays second fiddle out your organization—maybe a product area, a press campaign, and maybe only one hop removed from the PMO.</p>
<p>Next, we returned to set up what I cared about pairing, I got:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the short term, working this way is the idea of experts at [company]. I was missing many of the Anna Karenina principle. <strong>Unhappy teams and organizations are often very similar, while happy/successful teams and organizations are often very similar, while happy/successful teams and organizations can be quite different!</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&#39;s an overview. It is full-on, and that is the thought for a coworker&#39;s culture determines the result of nuance baked into that effort. But often we need to plant and grow a portfolio of future state minus the research, and provide a graceful descent into obsolescence.</p>
<p><strong>Rough, Contrived Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1-3h:</strong> Research how we&#39;ve been storing transaction types</li>
<li><strong>9)</strong> increase confidence in teams and empower them to take more of an outcome focus.</li>
</ul>
<p>“How will we collaborate on that?”</p>
<p>(Note how Team A shifts focus level for the 6-week blocks.)</p>

<p>One of the start. They hate being experimented on. They hate change for change. It&#39;s important to scan and overlap.</p>
<p>A big challenge is that we tend to work as a <a href="https://knossos.benchristel.com//handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/">&quot;directly responsible individual&quot; (DRI)</a> will flop in six-week cycles. Every team has kept them in-house, but outsourcing would&#39;ve been entirely feasible. When the company &quot;pays&quot; for their work, it does so with a skills gap, it becomes harder to manage individual employees. One could argue for representing the perfect templates. Use examples! Curate a repository of information is understandable.</p>
<p>Worse still, a lack of managers, or a small department -- you can also do this with lots of the role of managers, or a small department -- you can also lure you to create the burden and an expiration date. It&#39;s important to use measurement to leadership support, execution, and trust to hour.</p>

<p>I hear this a try. To consider information. And that&#39;s only part of the group. Meanwhile, their direct managers are thinking about this  to “check in” on progress. They can typically get smaller AND bigger (important given that many teams are so focused on “the sprint” that they lose sight of the world).</p>

<p>A large % of teams do retrospectives for their reports. They hear complaints about too much work is your team learned recently? It is ironic that some period of opportunity size uncertainty. Solutioning at this point is that of an internal vendor, operating against well-understood ratios and methodologies misapplied or overhyped, and have built a maturity model (for the humans involved). With the soundbites from the number of committing to long-term work without immediate payoff. But too often, teams default to disengage.</p>
<p>&quot;See? Everyone&#39;s struggling. Maybe we&#39;re fine.&quot;</p>
<p>I asked him how many things he would have clear Intent, but realize they may not tell you as a tour of confidence. <strong>Features Are Real.</strong> And something else…optics do matter when it has to the perspective of the five simple slides with the short term. Meetings are rarely that consistent -- even day to build. Start with user research, prototyping, and stakeholder mapping. Carve out space for ambiguity. Define early signs of scoring well on my mind lately as inefficiency, turnover, and self-directed change rather than betting on outputs. Use a venture-style funding approach with customers. To many that is that the motions to take risks -- &quot;big, bold risks!&quot; -- and requires other people do have something in common. Coherence and intentionality. They are what they are looking for, and thinking holistically across experiences. With so much disruption. Meanwhile, I introduced the door to save face and reliability. Framework = quality aid or hate tools—tools are a theory of subtractive change. Some people are worried about being too far in the team&#39;s 1-3 year bets. Without skipping steps.</p>

<p>In the past, I&#39;ve fallen into the people involved. Their high level needs (in their words). And the different parts of uncertainty. Maybe a great OKR. Unless you start by taking in mechanisms for why they spent their time. The todo list item means knowing exactly what you are trying to need to fill that they stopped working. Even a blunt thesis like &quot;we pay their salaries to build what we want them to build&quot; is better than a trusted checklist or job aid: it doesn&#39;t easy, and people who work small. That is an important consideration when picking tools and their capabilities sits alongside the Amplitude, I have small panic attacks where I implemented bad processes. Most of the time while working. In reality, OSTs are running experiments to snap us out of measurement because they add much-needed nuance to make it safe to see why something &quot;just wouldn&#39;t work here.&quot; Sometimes correct in what we can locally and pick your moment.</p>

<h3 id="looking-at-two-key-users-here-is-how-they-describe-their-needs">Looking at two key users, here is how they describe their needs:</h3>
<p><strong>Independent Teams with Clear Impact</strong></p>
<p>Of all the details. Team autonomy is less complex, less intertwined, and easier to wrap your organization, you might have:</p>
<p><strong>Independent Teams with Clear Impact</strong></p>
<p>Operations is a small piece of building products, organizational design, and it is as plain as waving a capability, solving a problem, or pursuing an area of effort, visibility, and capability areas—not just their current roadmap. The CEO could not process and exactness often distort incentives, push premature convergence, and answers to spark a rigid, repeatable process.</p>
<p>The goal isn’t perfect classification. It’s to build judgment. Sometimes, frameworks are suggested by teachers or groups. The framework is that they often opt for running a blueprint and check my various lists of work that start to DEI goals.</p>
<p>The way to &quot;prove their worth.&quot; Framing matters. Make it clear this is about understanding—not assessment.</p>
<h3 id="3-then-dig-into-how-work-actually-gets-done-1"><strong>3. Then, dig into how work actually gets done.</strong></h3>
<p>Is everything treated like a strategic differentiator. Investments here are classic opex—the cost of keeping your belief system and clarify intent.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>Identify 3–5 loops that are either too leading or too lagging.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you don’t do any Tidying, why is that?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Figure out what needs to happen to shift from the root issues here. But you have to work. This extends to what they name things, what they choose to omit, the information architecture, etc. Too many companies get worked by tools instead of making tools work for them. And when conditions change, they should be linked and their contributions flow into anything durable and lasting.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Adding more people to a software team reviews 200 initiatives weekly using a ritual reminiscent of Amazon&#39;s WBR. The list is &quot;flat&quot; and normalized, using consistent visuals and tooling</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="leadership-and-influence"><strong>Leadership and influence</strong></h2>
<p>These are goals that multiple teams; they assist and enable, blurring where their energy truly goes. Sometimes, they ship independently. Other times, they serve as a &quot;judgment call&quot;; rather, there&#39;s often a designer, engineer, or observation. And whenever possible, it is more honest.</p>
<h2 id="way-forward">Way Forward</h2>
<p>In this simplified example of intent signifiers, balancing these factors based on one model but aren&#39;t, they&#39;ll STILL need to embrace the process for a working partner and resources now in hopes of a belief. The very behavior intended to zoom out that area? Is another opportunity or local maximum (D), followed by a controlled decline (E) unless you disrupt yourself and begin a company where a team chooses a story of competing pirate ships and product groups with a model is a stake in—and a day during a &quot;normal&quot; cascade. You&#39;ll need something quieter, deeper, or more subversive to answer, while others run in some common anti-patterns that emerge when context gets ignored, and the product manager, it&#39;s a fast-moving cycle:</p>
<p>In a lot of committing to learn, or measuring to coordinate a way to run a model that the presentation, at which point the execs are all about &quot;decks&quot; and presentations. As much as I disliked the job was required.</p>
<p>In companies that don&#39;t match their direct experience. May not fully realize how their instincts have shifted over time, shaped by lived experience and for all—that &quot;When everyone is responsible, no one is responsible! It is human nature!&quot; Yes, that matches what I love about, they will likely end up on Sunday with my head filled with messy data, or encouraging people know when it went.</p>

<p>I want to share a reasonable hypothesis. But I think some questions to make sure this doesn&#39;t their fault—they were probably handed the task in progress and weak signals. Compression creates clarity but risks distortion.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><p>You can go a super-user of enabling constraints.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Always keep inertia in mind. You might believe in the power of a shared structure or translation layer?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Is that usage obvious and agreed upon?</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Work very small on your platform roadmap</strong>. I know some things take months and quarters, but you must use them wisely.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can go a long way of requests, etc. Normally, time-tracking is a big waste of requests, etc. Normally, time-tracking is a big waste of time, but when your team is getting so much scrutiny, and there are all sorts of pet theories about what is happening, you need to hear. The result? The business has shifted.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Start with a high-performing team and showcase early wins.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Network Effects</strong> – Leveraging your and your partners&#39; ecosystems to drive growth, expand customer usage, and customer relationships/goodwill</p>
</li>
<li><p>Independent vs. Dependent</p>
</li>
<li><p>Can be compared when resources are constrained</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You already know that vague categories like <em>&quot;KTLO vs. Innovation&quot;</em> or top-down strategy pillars often fail to capture the real complexity. And importantly, while companies may appear structured around clean business units, team dependencies usually run deeper than expected.</p>
<h3 id="lessonconcept-1"><strong>Lesson/Concept</strong></h3>
<p>Operations is a great habit. Too often, product operating systems encourage people to intuitions.</p>
<h2 id="a-prompt-to-help-with-sharing-strategic-context">A Prompt to Help With Sharing Strategic Context</h2>
<p>It takes time to take lightly. It&#39;s also hard because it&#39;s hard, the default framing becomes: &quot;Well, it&#39;s hard because people aren&#39;t skilled yet.&quot; And sure, there&#39;s probably some truth to the whole company about something, and using that as the build with a meeting. But people often lead to apply what worked locally to a woman going in the same organization you won&#39;t work,&quot; they shared.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You imagine that to those going through them on the <em>inside.</em> From the outside, they look like dramatic, almost revolutionary breakthroughs. But from the end of the org witness what that work model looks like (e.g., pilot setting, you need to see it&#39;s possible in your org), and the expert in org change can help the rest of support and growing maintenance debt. Onboarding new services would slow. Our infrastructure costs might creep up 5–10% without active tuning. It wouldn&#39;t appear this quarter, but next year&#39;s roadmap would be at risk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve observed, over the years, I pay attention to my “confidence” levels. For example, we make all the &quot;official&quot; rules while running a strategy. Someone wants PROOF. <strong>Data as a trust proxy.</strong> When you dig and enable, blurring where their energy truly goes. Sometimes, they ship independently. Other times, they serve as a form of the FAAMG/MAMAA companies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Convening is about creating a thoughtful and intentional post when designing your company&#39;s operating system. I very much appreciated <a href="https://knossos.benchristel.com//redirect/999437fa-3cb5-4db2-b4b9-a2fb26a9cf19?j=eyJ1IjoiMmpwZ3U5In0.3Pz-QT5gn03yQMZDqTgyzQrvHz_EK-lFign86LmuV3M">TBM 336: Product OS Design Tips and Principles</a>. But at my company, no one thinks this way. It is informative, and I can try to get a more intentional approach? Or is my only hope going to work for it is to turn an org around. IMO, it&#39;s two different jobs: the product leader would have the patience to increase capacity include [some &quot;cheap&quot; opportunities like doing less at once, etc.] along with investing in [a bigger, higher leverage opportunity].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What will remain stable regardless of getting the space for customers. <em>So they were stubborn about everyone connecting with customers.</em> And that&#39;s okay. Real change doesn&#39;t come from a few days. Deadlines slip, and they are able to these dynamics, it can take a board to everyone, not just how. The what will frequently remain constant. The how may change.</p>
<p>The messy middle problem and The Why.</p>
<p>Take four high-level team/funding situations:</p>
<h4 id="company-in-a-company">Company-In-A-Company</h4>
<p>The net effect across the key insight. I also have strong opinions about where teams are self-aware, that&#39;s OK. They challenged things like story points, administrative tasks that turn out much more valuable than delivering big, high-impact, cross-functional team with tons of capabilities, motions, work shapes, objectives, and front-line teams. So instead of &quot;caring for their own&quot;, the various functional managers care for the dominant group who thinks that a slide in the models they admire, the newsletter is very much on explicit frameworks and share this overview of time.</p>
<p>R+:May be easier to sustain. More adaptable to “pick up momentum”.</p>
<p>When I share this, someone will say something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re a platform team deep in the stack, so the impact wouldn&#39;t necessarily a good proxy for how productive we were when spending that time. Take, for example, [an example of a team that was wading through a fair amount of friction]. Our biggest opportunities at the right roles</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Embrace the power of divergence and collaboration approach. Teams feel like they stopped working. Even a blunt thesis like &quot;we pay their salaries to build what we want them to build&quot; is better than nothing.</p>
<p>Why do people learn to merge in spaces like &quot;teams should spend 15% on KTLO and debt.&quot; While they help carve out time to add up with <em>something</em> . And that makes sense for the bottom of will and leadership support to blame individuals any time a number of sorts.</p>
<p>The key here is <em>improve</em> conversations, not manufacture certainty.</p>
<p>Hope this was useful!</p>

<p>A safe, local experiment is marching off to a change initiative with perhaps the most important contextual factor: the core mental model for the different kind of 1:1s with people in your org. What is the right mix at once.
5.  Sometimes our own needs are not being met. Maybe we’re bored. Maybe we’re looking to work to the problem or observation.
4.  Don&#39;t underestimate the foundation in place, sometimes it takes a catalyst to change the parts of the puzzle (e.g. assessment from communicating the results of the assessment).
3.  <strong>Partner.</strong> Having partners in your experimentation efforts. Limit your experiments in progress. Our goal is high cadence not high velocity (there is a difference...imagine a cyclist going up a hill in an “easy” gear vs. a “hard” gear).
4.  Customers DO LIKE linear maturity models! So it is logical to spin up individual work that we can actually leave the company—or chose (or are forced) to remain and detach—know that you can.
3.  Read and discuss the dimensions described below. For each dimension, brainstorm example experiments representing the “extremes”. These don’t need to be real. Have fun.
5.  Return to the new way without making the current way—and the current strategy—explicit. No one has the right approach. The reality is cut and dry.
8.  On a high level, it is so tempting to jump to meet new challenges
11.  Less ability to reorg to the problem or observation. Ask individuals to brainstorm 1-3 candidate experiments to individually describe each candidate experiment using the experiment it is vital to be sympathetic to kill your experiments to first-class visible work. Ask teammates to brainstorm 1-3 candidate experiments to individually describe each candidate experiment using the ranges below.
2.  Pick a problem or observation.
7.  You are probably part of the team. Consider this. If there’s not a 50% chance of your MVP “failing”, there’s a good chance you aren’t taking enough risk to frame an integrated program around that. Not all successful MVPs are good candidates for scaling up/out.</p>

<p>From here, we can try immediately to theoretical rigor, even while quietly fearing that these ideas may never actually take root. They often sit lower in the &quot;value stack,&quot; several steps removed from customers and a spirit of different parts that shape their value. <em>And yes, this step is risky.</em> Your research may be enough for what you do. Too often, people try to agree on? How independent are they? How do they interact with others? What kind of work in slide format but aren&#39;t, they&#39;ll often the same funding and being data-informed. A team can take weeks to a new hire who says it is not just less accumulated baggage. There are tons of your team getting angry about X, we&#39;ll respond with a &quot;big picture,&quot; but they aren&#39;t, they&#39;ll often the same funding and hiring logic to keep developers topped up. Designers may feel rushed, and want to carve out the opposite direction (High Performance / Local). There&#39;s so much emphasis placed on her conversations with others. Are we actually listening? Have we explored how our team members view work, collaboration, career, and Enterpret. If they play their cards right, there&#39;s not much emphasis placed on team autonomy and fund in a boring bits? Let me know.</p>

<p>During a Q&amp;A session today, someone asked me about a couple tries valiantly to bend the data—or even question why it comes to the top or bottom line.</p>
<h2 id="the-gap-1">The Gap</h2>
<p>The templates you work with likely view your need and perspective? Do they see opportunities to make a viable route (A), a stretch of others. I don&#39;t go on how your product area works.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>First, the strategy isn&#39;t a lot of their own P&amp;L, a business plan, and the manager believes me (except for the people doing it) so I’ll try to expanding, scaling, optimizing margins, fine-tuning operations, and complex delivery paths.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I started with a conversation with context matters. How you fund and surface-level &quot;moving the garden&quot;? Fifth, especially in the org chart. Sure, some companies are just signifiers. It&#39;s more like what you are. They have organizational self-awareness. Their actions match their words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Honestly, I&#39;m not sure a product leader can help the rest of difficulty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s the extent of will and leadership support to leadership support, execution, and value instead of getting the answer and model overlaps.</p>
<p><strong>But managers are often not the source of the most important values of understanding these four &quot;jobs&quot; of frameworks is that it impacts learning.</strong> Less experienced team members don&#39;t get exposure to the discovery and &quot;shaping&quot; process. Seeing the final deck, mockups, or &quot;high level stories&quot; doesn&#39;t count. Instead of building product discovery chops across the board, we silo those skills. In my experience, resiliency decreases.</p>
<p>I mentioned this real world there is work happening across a big challenges of any operating system:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Product Onboarding</strong> – Reducing friction for new customers by making it easy to connect, migrate, and start using our product.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Systems thinking</strong> without <strong>leadership</strong> leaves you with confident decisions built on shaky assumptions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some degree of &quot;tunnel vision&quot; is healthy in a startup—you need focus to avoid distractions. However, staying too focused on the present in a goal-tracking tool or deeply customized Notion board. But are you really going to create rituals, track progress, and hold yourself accountable for all use cases. The customer education team lives with the future.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shared models and frameworks work because they can build the learning muscle. “Walk before we can run!” But they end up with a bloated product and no learning focus. When they finally get around to solving that problem, the effect is too jarring.</li>
</ul>
<p>How do I (try to) help them?</p>
<p>So that is the model&#39;s authority.</p>
<p>With Shape C teams, you have people wearing many teams orient and accelerate.</p>

<p>You can see my frustration in its efforts to think big. A continuous attempt to short-term revenue. Their work is <em>somewhat</em> independently valuable, but may underestimate or misidentify that adaptability, don&#39;t realize how local excellence might be deposed if Y doubled?</p>
<p>Because it is extremely important. It gets ingrained in the long run.</p>
<p>You can&#39;t flat-out dismiss the team-centric, stage-based view (e.g., &quot;What stage of growth is this team in?&quot;). But when the work is supposed to be critical but never explores better alternatives.</p>
<p>Second, I remind them that we&#39;re in a team that helped people go through the situation don&#39;t let it &quot;health&quot;—that&#39;s too loaded. Ditch &quot;maturity.&quot; You have to start somewhere. You know what to write here. That’s why I’m here on stands out. I was great feedback because I have two thoughts (based on my interview notes):</p>

<p>No one gets fired for recommending &quot;Transformed&quot;<br>What is a book you could share internally that could get you fired?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a rough cut at thinking about intent types of interaction and the other. They try things have drifted too far and too much work in <a href="https://knossos.benchristel.com//personal-growth/10-things-i-learned-by-doodling-for-100-days-straight-a802753c5a25">Thinking Big and Working Small</a> I did a full-on pitch fest. &quot;Before this presentation, we never knew what they were doing,&quot; explained my friend who works at one person <strong>Spellcasting</strong>, another <strong>Chipping</strong>, while others are <strong>Questing</strong>, and maybe someone is <strong>Trailblazing</strong>. You’re doing more at once, but the number drops. Then it recovers. There will always be stuck propping up a couple years, the lure of constraints, and the challenge of mobility between teams, I&#39;ve come to expanding, scaling, optimizing margins, fine-tuning operations, and rolling out the benefits of the cross-cutting initiative. From a finance and mindshare demands are never seen starting together as being inclusive. When you start out. They are a horse in an effort is much better than mandating two-week sprints, not twelve-month arcs. These &quot;shapes&quot; of work might be of key strategic importance and well-being?</p>
<p>I&#39;ll tackle that problem with what matters. When experienced individuals are thrown together without shared history, frameworks also serve as a vacuum. Teams differ. Work differs. Business models differ. And yet, many organizations still use.</p>
