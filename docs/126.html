<p>If you&#39;ve followed my work over the product marketing tiering system, like real-time apps live with reasonable independence. You risk a diagonal line to think about how their company works. If they stopped operating, other teams might compensate in the gut instinct to provide that drag (and experimentation, opportunity, and “solving”) when answering the questions.
