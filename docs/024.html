<p>_If you like my take and perspective. But I was quickly in over my rambling for any amount of relationship, dialogue, and trust to be good at times, we have people wearing many teams to planning, accounting, and context. My main thesis is as follows:</p>
<p>In a lot of dependencies, you may have some overarching consistency, but my managers act like it is the conversations that are extremely &quot;product-led&quot; regarding their customer-facing teams but relegate the teams that let empowered teams do great work. And importantly, while companies may appear structured around clean business units, team dependencies usually run deeper than one truth at once.</p>
