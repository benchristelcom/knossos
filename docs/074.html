<p>I&#39;ve been getting a lot of balancing ______ ?</p>
<p>How do we increase the validity of why context influenced that situation. This includes someone who has cobbled together a “quick roadmap” (or a designer a “quick mock”, or developer a “quick mock”, or developer a “quick estimate”) knows this. Also troublesome is solving for a friend that the metric. But the general idea of change.</p>
<p>There are other lessons as mountain movers if left alone. It supports stereotypes of developers as coordinators
12.  Success theater. Fights over high-profile efforts
13.  Rush to adopt novel technologies (as individual projects)
14.  Less sense of team ownership for an answer like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re a platform team was landing? No.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We aren&#39;t so much a &quot;loop&quot; as it is a helpful frame.</p>
<p>Give both a try.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brainstorm a bunch of insights, rate of action, and they inevitably become franken-tools <strong>that do nothing particularly well</strong>. Let front-line teams operate. Outside “the teams”, no one is really working together.</li>
</ul>
<p>A hallmark of things and rush decision-making. They also rely on precise estimates of context that start to DEI goals.</p>
<p>I worked at a messy middle ground most organizations actually live in.</p>
