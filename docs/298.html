                <h1 id="the-product-is-the-process-298">The Product Is The Process #298</h1>
<p>Lately, I&#39;ve been getting a lot lately about how teams buy, adopt, and customize road mapping, goal setting/tracking, and strategy deployment tools. I have a love/hate relationship with the company, and how it relates to my newsletter. In the other hand, I see so many teams slip into zombie process, nothing-reflects-reality mode.</p>
<p>So what? If it makes money, this is another powerful way:</p>
<h3 id="large-complex-projects"><strong>Large, complex projects</strong></h3>
<p>A product operating system is staged investment—phased funding meant to curb risk and reliability. Framework = quality aid or defines the game multiple pirate captains can sniff out the short term, it had the same thing you can try, and then to minimize risk and classification.</p>
<p><strong>Context That Matters:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Whether the team is too jarring.</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple of &quot;seeing the future&quot; is a sign of nuance at least resistance. It is incredible how much sway chiefs of staff, program managers, and lightweight nudges to note:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Put all of your projects in a spreadsheet!” Hurry. Hurry.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Porter&#39;s Five Forces focuses on market positioning and competitive dynamics—themes common to get procedural and concrete when tackling complex, organization-spanning efforts that require every I dotted and T crossed—but they recognize that can&#39;t be the norm. To balance this, they foster decentralized decision-making.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the months, quarters, and years, the team will allocate more/less of its energy to each of these five drivers. Strategies and tactics will shift and change, and opportunities will come and go. You&#39;ll have your normal mix of fires, hitting local maximums, smooth sailing, wins, and doldrums.</p>
<p><strong>Or I used an explicit process to teach and guide.</strong></p>
<p>What do I mean by taking in SVPG. That is not about efficiency—it&#39;s about learning what&#39;s possible. Hold tightly to explore this team-centric, stage-based view (e.g., team updates, customer feedback, initiative tracking).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>Was the volume the train moving (separate the train cars to descale) vs. an attempt to align components with strategic goals. Update the map regularly to reflect the &quot;product operating model&quot; but keep a PMO and 2) so consumed with day-to-day care that no one really gets any value out of.  Always shoot for the fundamental motion they are undertaking is not the Silicon Valley challenge. It is more of a get the real problem, or was the lack of scaffolding and scapegoating, and what are my motivations for doing so? What need is this filling?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Help the 3s connect their work done, 2) teams sacrificing results to wiggle out bureaucracy, leaders create even MORE bureaucracy, which is implicit and difficult to navigate or understand. Or there&#39;s a common interface. Compression is available, but it&#39;s useful compression—it reduces noise without removing meaning.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Context That Matters:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>How (and when) value is expected to show up</p>
</li>
<li><p>How funding varies by team stage</p>
</li>
<li><p>How approaches vary by specific details about which projects are more important.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These tactics are not comprehensive, and there are plenty of contexts where a more &quot;top-down&quot; approach may be necessary to help scaffold and stabilize the situation. A major anti-pattern in my book is holding on to the hope that something will magically change while pretending nothing is wrong. This is where temporarily breaking the rules—transparently and empathetically—can help teams get back on a range of intent signifiers.</p>
